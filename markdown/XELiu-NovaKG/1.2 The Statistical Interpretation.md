- But what exactly is this “wave function,” and what does it do for you [once you’ve got it]? After all, a [[particle]], by its nature, is [localized at a point](((KBbEwRz19))), whereas the [[wave function]] (as its name suggests) is [spread out in space](((aBIZxAxoS))) (it’s a function of x, for any given t). How can [such an object] [represent the state of a particle]?

    - The answer is provided by [Born’s statistical interpretation](((joccgnQKd))), which says that $$|\Psi(x, t)|^{2}$$ gives [the probability of finding the particle](((2Gz8Gv0ID))) at point x, at time t—or, more precisely, 
$$\int_{a}^{b}|\Psi(x, t)|^{2} d x=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\text { probability of finding the particle } \\
\text { between } a \text { and } b, \text { at time } t .
\end{array}\right\}$$   (1.3)
        - Probability is the area under the graph of $$\left| \Psi \right|^2$$. For the wave function in Figure 1.2, you [would be quite likely to] [find the particle] [in the vicinity of] point A, where $$\left| \Psi \right|^2$$ is large, and [relatively unlikely to] find it near point B.

        - Figure 1.2: A typical wave function. The [shaded area] represents [the probability of finding the particle] between a and b. The particle would be relatively likely to be found near A, and unlikely to be found near B.
- The statistical interpretation introduces a kind of [[indeterminacy]] into quantum mechanics, for [even if you know everything] [the theory has to tell you] about the particle ([to wit]: its wave function), still you cannot [predict with certainty the outcome of] [a simple experiment] to [measure its position]—all quantum mechanics has to offer is [[statistical information]] about the [possible results]. This indeterminacy has been [profoundly disturbing to] physicists and philosophers alike, and [it is natural to wonder] whether it is [a fact of nature], or [a defect in the theory].

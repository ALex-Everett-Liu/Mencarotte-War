- There’s an amphora
of old wine in the house
of nine years’ vintage.
There is in the garden, Phyllis,
laurel for [braiding crowns](((UfPQiHGBq)))
and much ivy . . . 
I invite you to celebrate
this day in mid-April—
a festive one for me,
dearer than [my own birthday]. (IV, 11)

- ### GRANULARITY
    - [Granularity](((gi3XJ6GnS))) is [the most characteristic feature of] quantum mechanics, which takes its name from this: “quanta” are [elementary grains]. 颗粒 [A minimum scale] [exists for all phenomena]. 51 For the gravitational field, this is called the “[[Planck scale]].” Minimum time is called “[[Planck time]].” Its value [can be easily estimated by] [combining the constants] that [characterize phenomena subject to] relativity, gravity, and quantum mechanics. 52 Together, these determine the time to 10^-44 seconds: [a hundred millionth of] a trillionth of a trillionth of [a trillionth of a second]. This is Planck time: at this [extremely minuscule level], [[quantum effect]]s on time [become manifest].

        - [51]: [It is not possible to] locate a [[degree of liberty]] in a region of its [[phase space]] within a volume smaller than the Planck constant.
        - [52]: The speed of light, the Newton constant and the Planck constant.

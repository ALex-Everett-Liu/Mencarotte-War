- There’s an amphora
of old wine in the house
of nine years’ vintage.
There is in the garden, Phyllis,
laurel for [braiding crowns](((UfPQiHGBq)))
and much ivy . . . 
I invite you to celebrate
this day in mid-April—
a festive one for me,
dearer than [my own birthday]. (IV, 11)

- ### GRANULARITY
    - [Granularity](((gi3XJ6GnS))) is [the most characteristic feature of] quantum mechanics, which takes its name from this: “quanta” are [elementary grains]. 颗粒 [A minimum scale] [exists for all phenomena]. 51 For the gravitational field, this is called the “[[Planck scale]].” Minimum time is called “[[Planck time]].” Its value [can be easily estimated by] [combining the constants] that [characterize phenomena subject to] relativity, gravity, and quantum mechanics. 52 Together, these determine the time to 10^-44 seconds: [a hundred millionth of] a trillionth of a trillionth of [a trillionth of a second]. This is Planck time: at this [extremely minuscule level], [[quantum effect]]s on time [become manifest].

        - [51]: [It is not possible to] locate a [[degree of liberty]] in a region of its [[phase space]] within a volume smaller than the Planck constant.
        - [52]: The speed of light, the Newton constant and the Planck constant.
- ### QUANTUM SUPERPOSITIONS OF TIMES
    - Even the distinction between present, past, and future thus becomes fluctuating, indeterminate. Just as a particle may be [diffused in space], so, too, the differences between past and future may fluctuate: an event may be both before and after another one.
- ### RELATIONS
    - “Fluctuation” [does not mean that] what happens is never determined. It means that it is determined [only at certain moments], and in an unpredictable way. [[indeterminacy]] is resolved when a quantity [interacts with something else].*
        - * [The technical term for] interaction [used in this context], “measure,” is misleading because [it seems to imply that] in order to [create reality], we need an [experimental physicist] [in a white coat].
        - In the interaction, an electron [materializes at a certain point]. 具现化 For example, it collides with a screen, is captured by a [[particle detector]], or collides with a photon—thus acquiring a [concrete position].

        - [But there is a strange aspect to] this [materialization of the electron]: the electron is concrete [only in relation to] the other [physical objects] it is interacting with. 56 With regard to all the others, [the effect of the interaction] is only to [spread the contagion of indeterminacy]. Concreteness occurs only in relation to a physical system: this, I believe, is the most radical discovery made by quantum mechanics.*
    - When an electron collides with an object—the screen of an old television set with a cathode ray tube, for example—the cloud of probability with which we conceived of it “collapses” and the electron materializes at a point on the screen, producing one of the luminous dots that goes into the making of a TV image. But it is only in relation to the screen that this happens. In relation to another object, the electron and screen are now together in a superposition of configurations, and it is only at the moment of further interaction with a third object that their shared cloud of probability “collapses” and materializes in a particular configuration—and so on.

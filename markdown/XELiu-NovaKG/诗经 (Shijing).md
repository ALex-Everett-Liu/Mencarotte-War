- Abstract
    - "Shijing" [[redirect]]s here. For [[other use]]s, see [Shijing ([[disambiguation]])].
    - The [[Classic of Poetry]], also Shijing or [Shih-ching] (Chinese: [詩經]; [[pinyin]]: [Shījīng]), [translated variously as]([[translated]]) the [Book of Songs], [Book of Odes] or [simply known as] the [Odes]([[ode]]) or Poetry (Chinese: 詩; pinyin: Shī), is the [oldest existing collection] of [Chinese poetry], comprising 305 works dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC. It is one of the "[[五经 (Five Classics)]]" traditionally said to have been [[compiled]] by [[Confucius]], and has been [studied and memorized] by scholars in China and [neighboring countries] [over two millennia]([[millennia]]). 
        - It is also a [rich source] of [[成语 (chengyu)]] (four-character classical [[idiom]]s) that are still a part of [[learned discourse]] 学术话语 and even [[everyday language]] in [modern Chinese]. Since the [[清王朝 (Qing dynasty)]], its [[rhyme pattern]]s have also been analysed in the study of [[Old Chinese phonology]].

        - [Subject]([[subject]]): [Ancient Chinese poetry] and song
    - [Early references] refer to the [[anthology]] as [the __300 Poems (shi)__]. The Odes [first became known as] a jīng, or a "[[classic book]]", [in the canonical sense], 在规范意义上 as part of the Han Dynasty [official adoption]([[adoption]]) of [[Confucianism]] as the [[guiding principle]]s of Chinese society.[__citation needed__] Before its [[elevation]] as a [[canonical classic]], 典范经典 the [Classic of Poetry (Shi jing)] [was known as] the __[Three Hundred Songs]__ or __[the Songs]__.[2]

        The same word shi [later became] a [[generic term]] for [[poetry]].[1] In English, lacking an exact [[equivalent]] for the Chinese, [the translation of the word] shi [in this regard] is generally as "poem", "[[song]]", or "ode". 
- ## Content
    - The Classic of Poetry contains [the oldest chronologically authenticated] Chinese poems.[1] 按年代顺序证实/鉴定为最古老的 The majority of the Odes date to the [[西周 (Western Zhou)]] period (1046–771 BC), and were [drawn from] around 15 [[kingdom]]s, those which were mainly [provinces and cities] in the [[中原 (Zhongyuan)]] area. 
        - A final [[section]] of 5 "Eulogies of Shang" [purports to be] [[ritual song]]s of the [[商王朝 (Shang dynasty)]] as [handed down by] their [[descendant]]s [in the state of Song]([[宋国 (Song State)]]), but is generally considered [quite late in date].[3][4] According to the [[东汉 (Eastern Han)]] scholar [[郑玄 (Zheng Xuan)]], the [latest material]([[material]]) in the Shijing was the song "Tree-stump Grove" (株林, 树桩林) in the "Odes of Chen", [dated to] the middle of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] ([c. 600 BC]).[5]

        - purport: shengcheng11, jucheng41, chuanshuo21, zhuangde xiangshi1044; yiwei44, yaozhi43, dasuan34

        - eulogy: chengsong14, zanci42
hymn: zanmeishi431, shengge41
    - The [[content]] of the Poetry [can be divided into] [two main sections]: the "Airs of the States", and the [eulogies and hymns].[9] The "[Airs of the States]([[国风 (Guofeng)]])" are shorter [[lyric]]s [in simple language] that are generally ancient [[folk song]]s which record the [[voice]] of the [[common people]].[9] They often speak of [[love]] and [[courtship]], longing for [an absent lover], 渴望一个缺席的情人 [[soldier]]s on [[campaign]], [[farming]] and [[housework]], and [[political satire]] and [[protest]].[9] 政治讽刺与抗议 
        - On the other hand, songs in the two "Hymns" sections and the "Eulogies" section tend to be longer [ritual song] or [[sacrificial song]]s, usually [in the forms of] [courtly panegyrics] and [dynastic hymns] 宫廷颂歌与王朝赞美诗 which praise the [[founder]]s of the [Zhou dynasty].[9] They also include hymns used in [[sacrificial rite]]s and songs used by the [[aristocracy]] in their [sacrificial ceremonies]([[sacrificial ceremony]]) 祭献/祭祀仪式 or at [[banquet]]s.[10][11]
201111-03:18 
    - "Court Hymns", contains "Lesser Court Hymns" and "Major Court Hymns". Most of the poems were used by the aristocracies to [[pray]] for [[good harvest]]s each year, [[worship god]]s, and venerate their [[ancestor]]s. 敬仰祖先 The author of "Major Court Hymns" are [nobilities]([[nobility]]) who were [dissatisfied with] the [[political reality]]. Therefore, they [wrote poems] not only related to the [[feast]], worship, and [[epic]] but also to reflect the [[public feelings]].[12]

        - Responding in praise to the one in Heaven,             對越在天
They hurry swiftly within the temple.                         駿奔走在廟
Greatly illustrious, greatly honored,                          不顯不承
May [King Wen] never be weary of [us] men.           無射於人斯
- ## Style
    - Whether the various Shijing poems were [folk songs] or not, they "all seem to have [passed through the hands of] [[men of letters]] at the [royal Zhou court]([[royal court]])".[13] In other words, they show an overall [[literary polish]] 文学润色 together with some general [[stylistic consistency]]. 文体上的一致性 
        - About 95% of lines in the Poetry are written in a [[four-syllable meter]], 四音节的韵律/调式 with a slight [[caesura]] 音顿/休止 between the second and third syllables.[9] Lines tend to occur in [[syntactically]] [related couplets]([[couplet]]), 句法相关的对联 with occasional [[parallelism]], and [longer poems] are [generally divided into] [similarly structured]([[similar structure]]) [[stanza]]s.[14] 结构相似的诗节
201112-23:29
    - All but six of the "Eulogies" consist of a [single stanza], and the "Court Hymns" [exhibit wide variation in]([[variation]]) [the number of stanzas] and their lengths. Almost all of the "Airs", however, consist of three stanzas, with [four-line stanzas] [being most common].[15][16] Although a few [[rhyming couplet]]s occur, the [[standard pattern]] in such [four-line stanzas] required a [[rhyme]] between the second and fourth lines. Often the first or third lines would [rhyme with these], or [with each other].[17] This style [later became known as] the "shi" style for much of [Chinese history].
201113-00:04
    - [One of the characteristics] of the poems in the __Classic of Poetry__ is that they [tend to possess] "elements of [[repetition]] and variation".[14] This results in an "[[alteration]] of [[similarities and differences]] in the [[formal structure]]: 形式结构的异同变化 in [[successive stanzas]], 连续的诗节 some lines and [[phrase]]s are [repeated verbatim], while others [vary from stanza to stanza]".[18] 
        - Characteristically, the parallel or syntactically [[matched lines]] [within a specific poem] [share the same], [[identical words]] (or characters) to a large degree, as opposed to [confining] [the parallelism between lines] to using [[grammatical category]] [[matching]] 语法范畴匹配 of [the words in one line] with the other word [in the same position] in the [[corresponding line]]; but, not by using the same, identical word(s).[14] Disallowing [[verbal repetition]] [within a poem] would [by the time of] [Tang poetry] be [one of the rules] to [[distinguish]] the [[old style poetry]] from the new, [[regulated style]].
201113-01:09, 01:35
        - verbatim: 逐字地; 完全照字面的; 直译; 速记
    - The works in the __Classic of Poetry__ vary in their [lyrical qualities], 抒情特质/品质 which relates to the [[musical accompaniment]] with which they were [in their early days] performed. The songs from the "Hymns" and "Eulogies", which are [the oldest material] in the Poetry, were performed to slow, heavy accompaniment from [[bell]]s, [[drum]]s, and [[stone chime]]s.[9] 编磬 However, these and the later actual [[musical score]]s or [[choreography]] which accompanied the Shijing poems [have been lost].
201113-17:25
    - [Nearly all of the songs] in the Poetry are rhyming, with [[end rhyme]], as well as frequent [[internal rhyming]].[14] While some of these verses still rhyme in [modern varieties]([[variety]]) of Chinese, others had ceased to rhyme by the [[Middle Chinese]] period. For example, the eighth song (芣苢 __Fú Yǐ__[b](((713BBbrpT)))) has a tightly [[constrained structure]] 严格约束的结构 [implying rhymes] between the [penultimate words] 倒数第二的 (here [shown in bold]) of [each pair of lines]([[line pair]]):[19]

        The second and third stanzas still rhyme in [modern Standard Chinese], with the [[rhyme words]] even [having the same tone]([[tone]]), but the first stanza [does not rhyme] in Middle Chinese or any [modern variety]. Such cases were attributed to [[lax rhyming practice]] 不严格的押韵实践 ^^until the [late-Ming dynasty] scholar [[陈第 (Chen Di)]] argued that the [original rhymes] [had been obscured by] [[sound change]].^^ Since Chen, scholars have analyzed the [[rhyming pattern]]s of the Poetry as [[crucial evidence]] for the [[reconstruction]] of [[Old Chinese phonology]].[20]

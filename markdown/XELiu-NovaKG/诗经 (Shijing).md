    - "Shijing" [[redirect]]s here. For [[other use]]s, see [Shijing ([[disambiguation]])].
    - The [[Classic of Poetry]], also Shijing or [Shih-ching] (Chinese: [詩經]; [[pinyin]]: [Shījīng]), [translated variously as]([[translated]]) the [Book of Songs], [Book of Odes] or [simply known as] the [Odes]([[ode]]) or Poetry (Chinese: 詩; pinyin: Shī), is the [oldest existing collection] of [Chinese poetry], comprising 305 works dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC. It is one of the "[[五经 (Five Classics)]]" traditionally said to have been [[compiled]] by [[Confucius]], and has been [studied and memorized] by scholars in China and [neighboring countries] [over two millennia]([[millennia]]). 
        - It is also a [rich source] of [[成语 (chengyu)]] (four-character classical [[idiom]]s) that are still a part of [[learned discourse]] 学术话语 and even [[everyday language]] in [modern Chinese]. Since the [[清王朝 (Qing dynasty)]], its [[rhyme pattern]]s have also been analysed in the study of [[Old Chinese phonology]].

- Abstract
    - "Shijing" [[redirect]]s here. For [[other use]]s, see [Shijing ([[disambiguation]])].
    - The [[Classic of Poetry]], also Shijing or [Shih-ching] (Chinese: [詩經]; [[pinyin]]: [Shījīng]), [translated variously as] the [Book of Songs], [Book of Odes] or [simply known as] the [Odes]([[ode]]) or Poetry (Chinese: 詩; pinyin: Shī), is the [oldest existing collection] of [Chinese poetry], comprising 305 works dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC. It is one of the "[[五经 (Five Classics)]]" traditionally said to have been [[compiled]] by [[Confucius]], and has been [studied and memorized] by scholars in China and [neighboring countries] [over two millennia]. 
        - It is also a [rich source] of [[成语 (chengyu)]] (four-character classical [[idiom]]s) that are still a part of [[learned discourse]] 学术话语 and even [[everyday language]] in [modern Chinese]. Since the [[清王朝 (Qing dynasty)]], its [[rhyme pattern]]s have also been analysed in the study of [[Old Chinese phonology]].

- ## Content 
    - The Classic of Poetry contains [the oldest chronologically authenticated] Chinese poems.[1] 按年代顺序证实/鉴定为最古老的 The majority of the Odes date to the [[西周 (Western Zhou)]] period (1046–771 BC), and were [drawn from] around 15 kingdoms, those which were mainly [provinces and cities] in the [[中原 (Zhongyuan)]] area. 
        - A [final section] of 5 "Eulogies of Shang" [purports to be](((B3hzqWB68))) [[ritual song]]s of the [[商王朝 (Shang dynasty)]] as [handed down by] their [[descendant]]s [in the state of Song]([[宋国 (Song State)]]), but is generally considered [quite late in date].[3][4] According to the [[东汉 (Eastern Han)]] scholar [[郑玄 (Zheng Xuan)]], the [latest material] in the Shijing was the song "Tree-stump Grove" (株林, 树桩林) in the "Odes of Chen", [dated to] the middle of the [[春秋时代 (Spring and Autumn period)]] ([c. 600 BC]).[5]

Greatly illustrious, greatly honored,                          不顯不承

- ## Style
    - Whether the various Shijing poems were [folk songs] or not, they "all seem to have [passed through the hands of] [[men of letters]] at the [royal Zhou court]([[royal court]])".[13] In other words, they show an overall [[literary polish]] together with some general [[stylistic consistency]]. 
        - About 95% of lines in the Poetry are written in a [[four-syllable meter]], with a slight [[caesura]] between the second and third syllables.[9] Lines tend to occur in [syntactically related] [[couplet]]s, 句法相关的对联 with occasional [[parallelism]], and [longer poems] are [generally divided into] [similarly structured] [[stanza]]s.[14] 结构相似的诗节

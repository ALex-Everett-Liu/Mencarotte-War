- [The Protectorate-General to Pacify the East] (simplified Chinese: 安东都护府; traditional Chinese: 安東都護府; pinyin: Āndōng Dūhùfǔ) was a [[protectorate]] [established by the Tang dynasty] in the northeast after [defeating the kingdom] of [[高句丽 (Goguryeo)]]. In the place of [[百济 (Baekje)]] and Goguryeo, the Tang created the Protectorate General to Pacify the East, [Ungjin Commandery]([[熊津都督府 (Xiongjin Dudufu)]]) and [Gyerim Territory Area Command]([[鷄林州都督府 (jilinzhou dudufu)]]).

- History
    - After the Tang dynasty conquered Goguryeo in 668, the Protectorate General to Pacify the East, otherwise known as the Andong Protectorate, was created in Pyongyang and supposedly stationed with 200,000 soldiers. The protectorate was divided into 9 [commanderies]([[commandery]]), 42 [[prefecture]]s, and 100 counties.[1][2][3]
    - In 669 the people of Goguryeo [revolted in response to Tang governance]. In response the Tang [forcibly deported] 78,000 households and [resettled them in empty areas](((oS8mkp0o5))) south of the Changjiang (Yangtze) and Huai River, each in contemporary China. [The weak and poor were left behind] and [assigned to guard duty] in service of the protectorate.[2]

    - From 670 to 673 [the rebels launched an uprising every year], [the last of which] [lasted for four years]. The [Goguryeo loyalists] were aided by the kingdom of [[新罗 (Silla)]], who were angered by [Emperor Gaozong of Tang]. Originally [Emperor Taizong of Tang] promised to exchange Baekje and the lands south of Pyeonyang in return for Silla's [military cooperation]. However Taizong died before [the conquest of Goguryeo] was completed, and his successor Gaozong [reneged on the promise].[4]
    - In 675 the Tang attacked Silla and defeated them in [[京畿道 (Gyeonggi)]]. In response [[文武王 (Munmu of Silla)]] [dispatched a tributary mission to] Tang with apologies. [[唐高宗 (Tang Gaozong)]] accepted Munmu's apologies and [withdrew Tang troops] to [deal with the Tibetan threat in the west]. Seeing the Tang's [strategic weakness], Silla [renewed the advance on] Tang territory.[5]

        - By 676 the Tang were [forced to retreat] and [relocate the protectorate seat to] the [more easily defendable city] of [[辽阳 (Liaoyang)]].[6][3][7]
        - In 677 the seat was moved to [[新城州 (Xincheng Zhou)]], in modern Fushun, Liaoning.[6][3][7]
        - In 667 the deposed [[寶藏王 (Bojang of Goguryeo)]] was designated "Liaodong Commander King of Joseon" (Korean: 요동주도독 조선왕; Hanja: 遼東州都督朝鮮王). Upon arriving in Liaodong, he plotted with the Mohe people to [revive Goguryeo](((GZW_DaPHH))). News of his intentions reached the Tang, and Bojang was [banished to southwestern China] in 681.[8]

        - In 736, the Tang formally recognized Silla's control of Korea south of the [[大同江 (Taedong River)]].[8] In 743, the seat was moved to [the Old City of Liaoxi], possibly [Ying Prefecture]([[营州 (Yingzhou)]]) (modern Chaoyang, Liaoning).[9][8][3]
        - The Protectorate General to Pacify the East, otherwise known as the [Andong Protectorate], was abandoned in 756 or ended in 761.[8][3]

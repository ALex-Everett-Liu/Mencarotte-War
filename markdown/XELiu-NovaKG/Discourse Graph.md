    - Seamlessly add additional [[semantic structure]] to your notes!
    - The Discourse Graph extension enables [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) users to seamlessly add additional semantic structure to their notes, including [specified page types] and [link types] that [model scientific discourse](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/fundamentals/what-is-a-discourse-graph), to enable more complex and structured [knowledge synthesis work](https://oasislab.pubpub.org/pub/54t0y9mk/release/3), such as [a complex interdisciplinary literature review], and [enhanced collaboration with others] on this work.

    - ## Overview
        - Here is [a relatively brief walkthrough of] some of the [main features] of the extension, including [creating discourse nodes and relations], and [using](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/guides/exploring-your-discourse-graph), [querying](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/guides/querying-your-discourse-graph), and [sharing](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/guides/sharing-your-discourse-graph) the discourse graph. [This is done in the context of]([[context]]) [an actual ongoing literature review]([[literature review]]).

- # Guides
    - ### Creating discourse nodes
        - The extension [makes it easy to] [factor parts of your notes into] [formal of a discourse graph] (claims, evidence, etc.).
        - [Simply select the text you want to turn into] a [formal discourse graph node] (e.g., QUE, CLM, EVD), then press hotkey (default is `\`, but [you can edit this in] the extension [config page]) to open up the refactor menu, and press appropriate [shortcut key] (e.g., E for evidence); system will create new page with the text as title and appropriate metadata and boilerplate sections.
    - ### Creating discourse relationships
        - **You can create [formal discourse relations] between nodes by [writing and outlining]!**
        - The extension has an in-built [grammar](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/fundamentals/the-discourse-graph-extension-grammar) that enables it to recognize when [certain patterns] of writing and outlining are meant to [express particular discourse relations] (e.g., support, oppose, inform) between discourse nodes. When it [recognizes these patterns], it "writes" them to a [formal discourse graph data structure], that you can then use to [explore or query your discourse graph].
- # Fundamentals
    - ### What is a Discourse Graph?
        - **Discourse graphs** are an [[information model]] for [bodies of knowledge] that emphasize [[discourse move]]s (such as questions, claims, and evidence), and relations (such as support or opposition), rather than [papers or sources] as the [main units]. #[[discourse graph]]
        - To [give an intuition for]([[intuition]]) what it is, [here is a figure of] a [visual representation] of [a simple discourse graph] for [a body of literature] on [bans and antisocial behavior] 禁令和反社会行为 in [[online forum]]s. You may [recognize similarities to things like] [[argument map]]s.

        - [Consider how that] information model foregrounds 突出 the [conceptual building blocks and relationships] that are [important for synthesis], compared to a typical "[iTunes for papers](http://joelchan.me/assets/pdf/2019-cscw-beyond-itunes-for-papers.pdf)" model that [foregrounds documents in a way that] [forces us to drudge through] [tedious extraction work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3295750.3298937) [before we can] [do the thinking we want to do]!

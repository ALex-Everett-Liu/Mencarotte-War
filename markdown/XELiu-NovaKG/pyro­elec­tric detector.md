- A **Pyroelectric detector** is an [infrared sensitive] [optoelectronic component] which are specifically used for detecting electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range from 2 to 14 µm.
    - A receiver chip of a pyroelectric [infrared detector](https://www.infratec.eu/sensor-division/service-support/glossary/infrared-detector/) manufactured by InfraTec consists of single-crystalline lithium tantalate. Because of its very high curie temperature of 620 °C lithium tantalate guarantees an extremely low temperature coefficient with an excellent long-term stability of the signal voltage.

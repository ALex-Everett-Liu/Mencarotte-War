- Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD)[2] is a fantasy [[tabletop role-playing game (TRPG)]] originally designed by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]].[3][4][5] It was first published in 1974 by [[Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR)]].[5] It has been published by [[Wizards of the Coast (WoC)]] (now a subsidiary of [[Hasbro]]) since 1997. The game was derived from [[miniature wargame]]s, with [a variation of](((tTwggwDIq))) the 1971 game [[Chainmail]] serving as the [initial rule system].[4][6] D&D's publication is [commonly recognized as] the beginning of [modern role-playing games] and the [role-playing game industry].[5][7]
    - D&D departs from [traditional wargaming] by allowing [each player] to [create their own character](((OiSn80n0U))) to play instead of a [[military formation]]. These characters embark upon [imaginary adventures](((VWTo127ui))) within a [fantasy setting]. A [[Dungeon Master (DM)]] serves as the game's [[referee]] and [[storyteller]], while [maintaining the setting] in which the adventures occur, and [playing the role of] [the inhabitants of the game world](((_u6WdhdH8))). The characters form a [[party]] and they [interact with the setting's inhabitants] and each other. Together they [solve dilemmas], engage in battles, explore, and [gather treasure and knowledge]. In the process, the characters earn [[experience points (XP)]] in order to [rise in levels](((5bc3frJUE))), and [become increasingly powerful] over [a series of separate gaming sessions].[3][7][8]

    - The early success of D&D [led to a proliferation of] similar [game systems]. Despite the competition, D&D has remained the [[market leader]] in the [role-playing game industry].[9][10] In 1977, the game was [split into two branches]: the relatively [rules-light game system] of [[basic Dungeons & Dragons]], and the more structured, [rules-heavy game system] of [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D)]] (abbreviated as AD&D).[11][12][13] AD&D 2nd Edition was published in 1989. 
        - In 2000, [a new system] was released as [[D&D 3rd edition]], continuing the [edition numbering](((N-ri3DzGb))) from AD&D; a [revised version](((lxcg71483))) 3.5 was released in June 2003. These 3rd edition rules [formed the basis of] the [[d20 System]], which is available under the [[Open Game License (OGL)]] for use by other [[publisher]]s. D&D 4th edition was released in June 2008.[14] The 5th edition of D&D, the most recent, was released [during the second half of 2014].[10]

    - In 2004, D&D remained the best-known,[15] and [best-selling](((gALqcHOeR))),[16] role-playing game in the US, with an estimated 20 million people [having played the game], and more than US$1 billion in book and equipment sales worldwide.[3] The year 2017 had "[the most number of players] in its history—12 million to 15 million in North America alone".[17] D&D 5th edition sales "were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game's [biggest sales year] yet".[10] 
        - The game [has been supplemented by] many [[pre-made adventure]]s, as well as commercial [[campaign settings]] [suitable for use by] [regular gaming groups].[18] D&D is [known beyond the game itself] for other [D&D-branded products], references in [[popular culture]], and some of the [controversies that have surrounded it](((Ke4HY9tgf))), particularly a [[moral panic]] in the 1980s [falsely linking it to] [[Satanism]] and [[suicide]].[3][19][20] The game [has won multiple awards] and [has been translated into many languages].
- # Play overview
    - Dungeons & Dragons is a structured, yet fundamentally [open-ended role-playing game](((bZic1sAda))). It is normally [played indoors] with [the participants seated around a tabletop]. Typically, one player [takes on the role of] Dungeon Master (DM) while the others [each control a single character], [representing an individual] in a [fictional setting](((OIpUD26oR))).[21] When working together as a group, the [[player characters (PCs)]] are often described as [a "party" of adventurers], with each member often [having their own area of specialty]([[area of specialty]]) which [contributes to the success of the whole].[22][23] 
        - During the course of play, each player [directs the actions of their character] and their [interactions with other characters] in the game.[7] [This activity is performed through] the [verbal impersonation](((F0p808xrg))) of the characters by the players, while [employing a variety of] [social]([[social skill]]) and other useful [[cognitive skill]]s, 认知技能 such as logic, basic mathematics and imagination.[24] A game often [continues over a series of meetings] to [complete a single adventure], and longer into a series of related [gaming adventures], called a "[[campaign]]".[7][25][26]

    - The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the DM according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules.[26][27] The DM selects and describes the various non-player characters (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions.[7][22] Encounters often take the form of battles with "monsters" – a generic term used in D&D to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures.[26] The game's extensive rules – which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions,[27] magic use,[28] combat,[27] and the effect of the environment on PCs[29] – help the DM to make these decisions. The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules[27] or make up new ones if they feel it is necessary.[30]
    - The most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three core rulebooks: The Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Monster Manual.[18]


    - The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of polyhedral dice. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage. Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures and various campaign settings.[18][22]

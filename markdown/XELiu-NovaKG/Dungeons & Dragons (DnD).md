- Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD)[2] is a fantasy [[tabletop role-playing game (TRPG)]] originally designed by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]].[3][4][5] It was first published in 1974 by [[Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR)]].[5] It has been published by [[Wizards of the Coast (WoC)]] (now a subsidiary of [[Hasbro]]) since 1997. The game was derived from [[miniature wargame]]s, with [a variation of](((tTwggwDIq))) the 1971 game [[Chainmail]] serving as the [initial rule system].[4][6] D&D's publication is [commonly recognized as] the beginning of [modern role-playing games] and the [role-playing game industry].[5][7]
    - D&D departs from [traditional wargaming] by allowing [each player] to [create their own character] to play instead of a [[military formation]]. These characters embark upon [imaginary adventures] within a [fantasy setting]. A [[Dungeon Master (DM)]] serves as the game's [[referee]] and [[storyteller]], while [maintaining the setting] in which the adventures occur, and [playing the role of] [the inhabitants of the game world]. The characters form a [[party]] and they [interact with the setting's inhabitants] and each other. Together they [solve dilemmas], engage in battles, explore, and [gather treasure and knowledge]. In the process, the characters earn [[experience points (XP)]] in order to [rise in levels], and [become increasingly powerful] over [a series of separate gaming sessions].[3][7][8]

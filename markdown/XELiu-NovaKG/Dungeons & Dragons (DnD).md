- Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD)[2](((vGPHlO-QM))) is a fantasy [[tabletop role-playing game (TRPG)]] originally designed by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]].[3](((8q4_g4Y1N)))[4][5] It was first published in 1974 by [[Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR)]].[5] It has been published by [[Wizards of the Coast (WoC)]] (now a subsidiary of [[Hasbro]]) since 1997. The game was derived from [[miniature wargame]]s, with [a variation of](((tTwggwDIq))) the 1971 game [[Chainmail]] serving as the [initial rule system].[4][6] D&D's publication is [commonly recognized as] the beginning of [modern role-playing games] and the [role-playing game industry].[5][7]
    - D&D departs from [traditional wargaming] by allowing [each player] to [create their own character](((OiSn80n0U))) to play instead of a [[military formation]]. These characters embark upon [imaginary adventures](((VWTo127ui))) within a [fantasy setting]. A [[Dungeon Master (DM)]] serves as the game's [[referee]] and [[storyteller]], while [maintaining the setting] in which the adventures occur, and [playing the role of] [the inhabitants of the game world](((_u6WdhdH8))). The characters form a [[party]] and they [interact with the setting's inhabitants] and each other. Together they [solve dilemmas], engage in battles, explore, and [gather treasure and knowledge]. In the process, the characters earn [[experience points (XP)]] in order to [rise in levels](((5bc3frJUE))), and [become increasingly powerful] over [a series of separate gaming sessions].[3][7][8]

    - The early success of D&D [led to a proliferation of] similar [game systems]. Despite the competition, D&D has remained the [[market leader]] in the [role-playing game industry].[9][10] In 1977, the game was [split into two branches]: the relatively [rules-light game system] of [[basic Dungeons & Dragons]], and the more structured, [rules-heavy game system] of [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D)]] (abbreviated as AD&D).[11][12][13] AD&D 2nd Edition was published in 1989. 
        - In 2000, [a new system] was released as [[D&D 3rd edition]], continuing the [edition numbering](((N-ri3DzGb))) from AD&D; a [revised version](((lxcg71483))) 3.5 was released in June 2003. These 3rd edition rules [formed the basis of] the [[d20 System]], which is available under the [[Open Game License (OGL)]] for use by other [[publisher]]s. D&D 4th edition was released in June 2008.[14] The 5th edition of D&D, the most recent, was released [during the second half of 2014].[10]

    - In 2004, D&D remained the best-known,[15] and [best-selling](((gALqcHOeR))),[16] role-playing game in the US, with an estimated 20 million people [having played the game], and more than US$1 billion in book and equipment sales worldwide.[3] The year 2017 had "[the most number of players] in its history—12 million to 15 million in North America alone".[17] D&D 5th edition sales "were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game's [biggest sales year] yet".[10] 
        - The game [has been supplemented by] many [[pre-made adventure]]s, as well as commercial [[campaign settings]] [suitable for use by] [regular gaming groups].[18] D&D is [known beyond the game itself] for other [D&D-branded products], references in [[popular culture]], and some of the [controversies that have surrounded it](((Ke4HY9tgf))), particularly a [[moral panic]] in the 1980s [falsely linking it to] [[Satanism]] and [[suicide]].[3][19][20] The game [has won multiple awards] and [has been translated into many languages].
- ## Play overview
    - Dungeons & Dragons is a structured, yet fundamentally [open-ended role-playing game](((bZic1sAda))). It is normally [played indoors] with [the participants seated around a tabletop]. Typically, one player [takes on the role of] Dungeon Master (DM) while the others [each control a single character], [representing an individual] in a [fictional setting](((OIpUD26oR))).[21] When working together as a group, the [[player characters (PCs)]] are often described as [a "party" of adventurers], with each member often [having their own area of specialty]([[area of specialty]]) which [contributes to the success of the whole].[22][23] 
        - During the course of play, each player [directs the actions of their character] and their [interactions with other characters] in the game.[7] [This activity is performed through] the [verbal impersonation](((F0p808xrg))) of the characters by the players, while [employing a variety of] [social]([[social skill]]) and other useful [[cognitive skill]]s, 认知技能 such as logic, basic mathematics and imagination.[24] A game often [continues over a series of meetings] to [complete a single adventure], and longer into a series of related [gaming adventures], called a "[[campaign]]".[7][25][26]

    - [The results of the party's choices] and the [overall storyline]([[storyline]]) for the game are determined by the DM [according to the rules of the game] and the DM's [interpretation of those rules].[26][27] The DM selects and describes the various [[non-player characters (NPCs)]] that [the party encounters], the settings in which [these interactions occur], and [the outcomes of those encounters] based on [the players' choices and actions](((L3FvZk611))).[7][22] 
        - Encounters [often take the form of] [battles with "monsters"]([[monster]]) – a [generic term](((XL_QF8r59))) used in D&D to describe potentially [[hostile beings]] 潜在的敌对生物 such as animals, [[aberrant beings]], 畸形生物 or [[mythical creature]]s.[26] The game's [extensive rules] – which [cover diverse subjects] such as [[social interaction]]s,[27] [magic use](((uvUjhmPKI))),[28] [[combat]],[27] and [the effect of the environment](((InMewINnd))) on PCs[29] – help the DM to [make these decisions]. The DM may [choose to deviate from](((SeIcWcPCC))) the [published rules][27] or [make up new ones] if they [feel it is necessary].[30]
    - The most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three core rulebooks: The Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Monster Manual.[18]
        - The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of polyhedral dice. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage. Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures and various campaign settings.[18][22]
    - An elaborate D&D game [in progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:D%26D_Game_1.jpg). Among the gaming aids here are dice, a variety of miniatures and [a dungeon diorama](((3U5CRu8dK))). 地牢透视图

        - Before the game begins, each player creates their [player characters (PCs)] and [records the details] (described below) on a [[character sheet]]. First, a player determines their character's [[ability score]]s, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. [Each edition of the game] has offered [differing methods] of [determining these scores].[31] The player then chooses a [[race]] ([[species]]) such as human or elf, a [[character class]] ([[occupation]]) such as fighter or wizard, an [[alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook), 道德和伦理观 and other features to [round out the character's abilities] and [[backstory]], which have [varied in nature through differing editions].

        - During the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response.[32] Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice.[33] Different polyhedral dice are used for different actions, such as a twenty-sided die to see whether a hit was made in combat, but an eight-sided die to determine how much damage was dealt.[34] Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills and the difficulty of the task.[35] In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided.[36][37] In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.[36][38]

- The analog interference signal recorded by the detector needs to be captured and digitized at the appropriate and predetermined OPDs. In this chapter, the instrument’s subsystem that produces the digital pulses to “clock” the data acquisition of the interferogram is discussed. This subsystem is referred to as the clocking system or the interferogram clocking system throughout the book.
    - Figure 6.1(a) shows a simple schematic of the clocking system. Figure 6.1(b) illustrates the interferogram sampling process, where the digital pulses synchronized with the moving mirror’s position are used to clock the data acquisition. The figure shows the most commonly employed scheme in which the clock pulses are separated by an equidistant interval, d s . It also shows clock positional error, ∆d s , which is discussed in detail later in the chapter.

- 6.3 Accuracy with Respect to OPD
    - Besides having a high enough frequency, the sampling-clock signal needs to be accurate with respect to the OPD. As discussed in the previous chapter, an HeNe-laser interferometer system is generally used to produce the sampling clock signal in an FTS, although other position sensing devices can also be used.

[He is mostly known for] his participation in the [successful coup] of 705 that overthrew Wu Zetian and returned her son [Emperor Zhongzong] to the throne, and the [failed coup] of 707 in which Emperor Zhongzong's son Li Chongjun tried to overthrow Emperor Zhongzong's wife [Empress Wei].

- Background
    - It is not known when Li Duozuo was born. His ancestors were said to be [Mohe chieftains](((zt0y3ge-X))) with the title "Yellow-headed Commandant" ([黃頭都督](((tGNuVAtbL))), Huangtou Dudu), but had, long before Li Duozuo's time, submitted to Chinese rule, and the [family history] was [not well preserved]. He was said to be [brave and strong], capable at archery, and for his [military achievements][2](((wwI4KjiOl))) was made You Yingyang Da Jiangjun (右鷹揚大將軍), one of the generals [commanding the imperial guards], [at the recommendation of] the general Pei Xingjian ([[裴行儉 (Pei Xingjian)]]). In one of the campaigns against the [[黑水靺鞨 (Heishui Mohe)]], he induced the chieftains of the Heishui Mohe to [feast with him] and [got them drunk], and then slaughtered them.

- During Wu Zetian's regency and reign
    - In 687, when Emperor Ruizong's mother [Empress Dowager Wu] (later known as Wu Zetian) served as [[regent]], there was an invasion by the [Eastern Tujue khan] [Ashina Gudulu] and his general Ashide Yuanzhen ([[阿史德元珍 (Ashide Yuanzhen)]]). Empress Dowager Wu commissioned the [ethnically Baekje general] [Heichi Changzhi]([[黑齒常之 (Heukchi Sangji)]]), assisted by Li Duozuo, to defend against Ashina Gudulu's attack, and they were able to defeat Eastern Tujue forces at Huanghuadui ([[黃花堆之战]], in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), causing Eastern Tujue [forces to flee].

    - In 694—by which time Empress Dowager Wu had [seized the throne from] [Emperor Ruizong], [establishing a new Zhou Dynasty] as its "emperor" and interrupting Tang—the Shiwei [rose against Chinese rule](((g-qHqKUvb))), and Li Duozuo was [commissioned against them]. He was able to defeat the Shiwei.
        - In 696, the Khitan chieftains Li Jinzhong and Sun Wanrong [launched a major rebellion against] Zhou rule, invading Zhou territory. Li Duozuo was one of the 28 generals sent against the Khitan, and after the [Khitan rebellion](((qaxA2ssRd))) ended in 697, Li Duozuo was [given the slightly greater office] of You Yulin Da Jiangjun ([[右羽林大將軍 (Right Yulin Dajiangjun)]]), and became [the commander of the imperial guards] [at the north gate of the palace].
    - In 702, when Wu Zetian was [apparently contemplating] [further military action in] the northeast 显然在考虑进一步的军事行动 and put the chancellor [[魏元忠 (Wei Yuanzhong)]] in command, Li Duozuo made [acting commandant] 代理指挥官 at You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing), assisted by the generals [Xue Na]([[薛訥 (Xue Ne)]]) and [Luo Wuzheng (駱務整)]. However, it appeared that [military action](((1zVlOFgCm))) was not launched.

- Coup of 705
    - As of spring 705, Wu Zetian was ill, and her lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong [wielded much power], [leading to speculation that] they might try to displace 取代 her son Li Xian the [Crown Prince]([[crown prince]]), a [former emperor] (Emperor Ruizong's [older brother]). The [[chancellor]] [[张柬之 (Zhang Jianzhi)]], who was [planning with other officials] Cui Xuanwei, Huan Yanfan, Jing Hui, and Yuan Shuji, to act against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, decided to engage Li Duozuo in the plot as well. He asked Li Duozuo, "Who [gave you this glory and honor], general?" Li Duozuo wept and responded, "The Great Emperor [(i.e., Wu Zetian's husband [Emperor Gaozong])]." Zhang Jianzhi then stated, "Now, the sons of the Great Emperor are [being endangered by two hoodlums], and do you not want to repay the Great Emperor?" Li Duozuo responded, "As long as it is [beneficial to the state], I will [follow your direction], chancellor. I do not dare to [consider my own safety] and that of my family." He therefore agreed to [join the plot](((DaB2Ttvyk))). 
        - Subsequently, with Li Xian's agreement, the [[coup]] leaders killed Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong and [surrounded Wu Zetian's palace], [forcing her to yield the throne to] Li Xian (as Emperor Zhongzong). For Li Duozuo's [participation in the coup], [Emperor Zhongzong]([[唐中宗 (Tang Zhongzong)]]) created him the [Prince of Liaoyang]. Later that year, when Emperor Zhongzong was [offering sacrifices] at the [imperial ancestral temple], he had Li Dan the [Prince of Xiang] (the former [Emperor Ruizong]) and Li Duozuo accompany him—a great honor—[against suggestions that] Li Duozuo, as a non-Han, should not be [given this great of an honor] equivalent to [the emperor's brother].

- Li Duozuo (Chinese: 李多祚; pinyin: Lǐ Duōzuò) (died August 7, 707[1]), formally the [Prince of Liaoyang (遼陽王)], was an ethnically Mohe general of [the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty] and [Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty]. [He is mostly known for] his participation in the [successful coup] of 705 that overthrew Wu Zetian and returned her son [Emperor Zhongzong] to the throne, and the [failed coup] of 707 in which Emperor Zhongzong's son Li Chongjun tried to overthrow Emperor Zhongzong's wife [Empress Wei].
- Background
    - It is not known when Li Duozuo was born. His ancestors were said to be [Mohe chieftains](((zt0y3ge-X))) with the title "Yellow-headed Commandant" ([黃頭都督](((tGNuVAtbL))), Huangtou Dudu), but had, long before Li Duozuo's time, submitted to Chinese rule, and the [family history] was [not well preserved]. He was said to be [brave and strong], capable at archery, and for his [military achievements][2] was made You Yingyang Da Jiangjun (右鷹揚大將軍), one of the generals [commanding the imperial guards], [at the recommendation of] the general Pei Xingjian ([[裴行儉 (Pei Xingjian)]]). In one of the campaigns against the [[黑水靺鞨 (Heishui Mohe)]], he induced the chieftains of the Heishui Mohe to [feast with him] and [got them drunk], and then slaughtered them.

- During Wu Zetian's regency and reign
    - In 687, when Emperor Ruizong's mother [Empress Dowager Wu] (later known as Wu Zetian) served as [[regent]], there was an invasion by the [Eastern Tujue khan] [Ashina Gudulu] and his general Ashide Yuanzhen ([[阿史德元珍 (Ashide Yuanzhen)]]). Empress Dowager Wu commissioned the [ethnically Baekje general] [Heichi Changzhi]([[黑齒常之 (Heukchi Sangji)]]), assisted by Li Duozuo, to defend against Ashina Gudulu's attack, and they were able to defeat Eastern Tujue forces at Huanghuadui ([[黃花堆之战]], in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), causing Eastern Tujue [forces to flee].

    - In 694—by which time Empress Dowager Wu had [seized the throne from] [Emperor Ruizong], [establishing a new Zhou Dynasty] as its "emperor" and interrupting Tang—the Shiwei [rose against Chinese rule](((g-qHqKUvb))), and Li Duozuo was [commissioned against them]. He was able to defeat the Shiwei.
        - In 696, the Khitan chieftains Li Jinzhong and Sun Wanrong [launched a major rebellion against] Zhou rule, invading Zhou territory. Li Duozuo was one of the 28 generals sent against the Khitan, and after the [Khitan rebellion](((qaxA2ssRd))) ended in 697, Li Duozuo was [given the slightly greater office] of You Yulin Da Jiangjun ([[右羽林大將軍 (Right Yulin Dajiangjun)]]), and became [the commander of the imperial guards] [at the north gate of the palace].
    - In 702, when Wu Zetian was [apparently contemplating] [further military action in] the northeast 显然在考虑进一步的军事行动 and put the chancellor [[魏元忠 (Wei Yuanzhong)]] in command, Li Duozuo made [acting commandant] 代理指挥官 at You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing), assisted by the generals [Xue Na]([[薛訥 (Xue Ne)]]) and [Luo Wuzheng (駱務整)]. However, it appeared that [military action](((1zVlOFgCm))) was not launched.

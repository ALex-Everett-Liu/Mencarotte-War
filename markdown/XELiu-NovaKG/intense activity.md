- One key to [good health] is [regular intense activity]. [Intensity minutes] [track your progress toward that goal].
- ### Your Weekly Progress
    - The [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] recommends [150 minutes per week] of [moderate intensity activity], such as [[brisk walking]], or 75 minutes per week of [vigorous intensity activity], such as [[running]]. Here are your current [total intensity minutes] for the week:

    - ### Vigorous Intensity
        - [You can only speak a few words between breaths] while exercising. Vigorous intensity minutes will only be recorded [when heart rate data is available].
    - ### Reaching Your Goal
        - You must do at least 10 minutes of moderate or vigorous intensity activity [at a time] for your Garmin [[activity tracker]] to count it. [Use any combination of] [moderate and vigorous exercise](((B8hHmYL7O))) to [achieve your goal] of 150 active minutes per week. [Each minute of] vigorous activity counts as two intensity minutes.

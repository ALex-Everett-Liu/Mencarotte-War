- In this chapter, the [[optical system]]’s [[throughput]] for FT spectrometers is [discussed first], and [with the aim to] [help the designer select] the [proper size] and “speed” of the focusing and the collimating optics, the diameter of the aperture, and the area of the detector element. Lenses and mirrors, the two types of focusing and collimating optics, are also briefly discussed. Finally, the alignment procedure for the interferometer is explained.

- 9.2 Lenses vs. Mirrors
    - Many [commercial FT spectrometers] use [[off-axis parabolic mirror]]s for [collimating light](((9lctvsya6))) and [focusing the light]([[focus light]]). [An important advantage of] [[mirror]]s is that [they have a much broader] [[spectral range]] than the [[lenses]] used today. This is because the radiation does not have to go through the material, as in the case of lenses. For example, gold-coated mirrors reflect more than 98% of radiation between 0.7 and 10 µm. Another advantage of parabolic mirrors used as focusing or collimating optics is that they do not have chromatic aberrations where different wavelength components are focused at different points (see Fig. 9.3). Note, however, that they still possess other types of aberrations.

- Resistance thermometers, also called [[resistance temperature detector (RTD)]]s, are sensors used to [measure temperature]([[temperature sensor]]). Many [RTD elements] [consist of a length of fine wire wrapped around] [a ceramic or glass core] but [other constructions are also used]. The RTD wire is [a pure material], typically [[platinum]], [[nickel]], or copper. The material [has an accurate resistance/temperature relationship] which is used to [provide an indication of] temperature. As RTD elements are [[fragile]], [they are often housed in] [[protective probe]]s.

    - RTDs, which have higher [[accuracy]] and [[repeatability]], are [slowly replacing] [[thermocouple]]s in [[industrial application]]s [below 600 °C].[1]
- Resistance/temperature relationship of metals
    - Common RTD [[sensing element]]s constructed of platinum, copper or nickel [have a repeatable resistance versus temperature relationship (R vs T)](((6Mppb7_2q))) and [operating temperature range]([[operating temperature]]). The [R vs T relationship] is defined as [the amount of resistance change] of the sensor [per degree of temperature change].[1] The [relative change] in resistance ([[temperature coefficient]] of resistance) [varies only slightly over] [the useful range of the sensor].

    - Platinum was proposed by [Sir William Siemens] as [an element for a resistance temperature detector] at the [Bakerian lecture] in 1871:[2] it is a [[noble metal]] and has the [most stable] [resistance–temperature relationship](((6Mppb7_2q))) [over the largest temperature range]([[temperature range]]). [Nickel elements] [have a limited temperature range] because [the amount of change in resistance] [per degree of change in temperature] [becomes very non-linear at temperatures over] 300 °C (572 °F). Copper has a very [linear resistance–temperature relationship]; however, copper [[oxidize]]s at [[moderate temperature]]s and [cannot be used over] 150 °C (302 °F).

    - The [significant characteristic] of [metals used as resistive elements]([[resistive element]]) is the [[linear approximation]] of [the resistance versus temperature relationship] [between 0 and 100 °C]. This temperature coefficient of resistance is denoted by α and is usually given in units of Ω/(Ω·°C):

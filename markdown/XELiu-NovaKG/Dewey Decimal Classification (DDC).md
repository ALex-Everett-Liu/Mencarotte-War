- The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), colloquially the [Dewey Decimal System], is a proprietary [[library classification]] system [first published in] the United States by [[Melvil Dewey]] in 1876.[1] Originally described in [a four-page pamphlet], it has been [expanded to multiple volumes] and revised through 23 [[major edition]]s, the latest printed in 2011. It is also available in an [[abridged version]] [suitable for smaller libraries]. OCLC, a [[non-profit cooperative]] 非营利合作社 that [serves libraries], currently [maintains the system]([[maintain the system]]) and [[license]]s [[online access]] to [[WebDewey]], [a continuously updated version]([[continuous update]]) for [[cataloger]]s.

- The Decimal Classification [introduced the concepts of] [[relative location]] and [[relative index]] which [allow new books to be added to a library] in their [[appropriate location]] based on [[subject]]. Libraries previously had given books permanent [[shelf location]]s that were related to [the order of acquisition] [rather than topic]. 
210310-23:44
    - The classification's [[notation]] makes use of [three-digit numbers] for [[main class]]es, with [[fractional decimal]]s 小数 [allowing expansion for further detail]. [Numbers are flexible] [to the degree that] 灵活到此种程度 they [can be expanded in linear fashion] to [cover special aspects of general subjects].[2] A library assigns a [[classification number]] that unambiguously [locates a particular volume] 特定的卷 in a position [relative to other books in the library], on the basis of its subject. The number [makes it possible to] [find any book] and to return it to its [[proper place]] on the [[library shelves]].[Note 1] The [classification system] is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.[3][4]

- ## History
    - ### 1873–1885: early development
        - Melvil Dewey (1851–1931) was an American [[librarian]] and self-declared [[reformer]].[5] He was a [founding member] of the [[American Library Association]] and [can be credited with] the promotion of [[card system]]s in libraries and business.[6] He [developed the ideas for] his library classification system in 1873 while working at [[Amherst College]] library. He applied the classification to the books in that library, until in 1876 he had a [first version] of the classification. In 1876, he [published the classification] in [pamphlet form] with the title __A [Classification and Subject Index] for Cataloguing and [Arranging the Books] and Pamphlets of a Library__.[7] 
            - He used the pamphlet, [published in more than one version] during the year, to [solicit comments from] other librarians. It is not known [who received copies] or [how many commented] [as only one copy with comments has survived], that of Ernest Cushing Richardson.[8] His classification system was mentioned in an article in the [[first issue]] 创刊号 of the __Library Journal__ and in an article by Dewey in the Department of Education publication "Public Libraries in America" in 1876.[9] In March 1876, he applied for, and [received copyright] on the first edition of the index.[10] The edition was 44 pages in length, with 2,000 [index entries], and was printed in 200 copies.[11]

- ## Design
    - The Dewey Decimal Classification [organizes library materials] by [[discipline]] or [field of study]([[study field]]). Main [[division]]s include philosophy, social sciences, science, technology, and history. The [[scheme]] comprises ten [[class]]es, each divided into ten divisions, each having ten [[section]]s. The system's notation uses [[Indo-Arabic number]]s, with three [whole numbers] [making up the main classes] and [[sub-class]]es and decimals [designating further divisions]. The [[classification structure]] is [[hierarchical structure]] and the notation follows the same hierarchy. Libraries not needing [the full level of detail] of the classification can [trim right-most decimal digits] from the [class number] to obtain more [general classifications].[41] For example:

        - ```css
500 Natural sciences and mathematics
	510 Mathematics
		516 Geometry
			516.3 Analytic geometries
				516.37 Metric differential geometries
					516.375 Finsler geometry
```
    - The classification was originally [[enumerative]], meaning that it [listed all of the classes] [explicitly in the schedules]. Over time it [added some aspects of] a [[faceted classification]] scheme, allowing [[classifier]]s to [construct a number] by combining [a class number for a topic] with [an entry from a separate table]. 单独的表 Tables cover [commonly used elements] such as geographical and temporal aspects, language, and bibliographic forms. 
210311-01:58
        - For example, a [[class number]] [could be constructed using] 330 for economics + .9 for geographic treatment + .04 for Europe to create the class 330.94 European economy. Or one could combine the class 973 (for the United States) + .05 (for [[periodical publication]]s ([[periodical literature]]) 期刊 [on the topic]) to [arrive at the number] 973.05 for periodicals [concerning the United States generally]. The classification also [makes use of] [[mnemonics]] in some areas, such that the number 5 represents the country Italy in classification numbers like 945 (history of Italy), 450 (Italian language), 195 (Italian philosophy). [The combination of faceting and mnemonics] makes the classification [synthetic in nature]([[synthetic]]), with meaning built into parts of the classification number.[42]
210311-02:49
    - The Dewey Decimal Classification has a number for all subjects, including [[fiction]], although many libraries maintain [a separate fiction section] shelved by [[alphabetical order]] of [the author's surname]. Each assigned number consists of two parts: a class number (from the Dewey system) and a [[book number]], which "[prevents confusion of] different books [on the same subject]".[7] A [common form] of the book number is called a [[Cutter number]], which represents the author and [distinguishes the book from other books] [on the same topic].[43]

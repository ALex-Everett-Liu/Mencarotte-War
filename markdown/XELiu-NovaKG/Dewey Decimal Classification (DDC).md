- The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), colloquially the [Dewey Decimal System], is a proprietary [[library classification]] system [first published in] the United States by [[Melvil Dewey]] in 1876.[1] Originally described in [a four-page pamphlet], it has been [expanded to multiple volumes] and revised through 23 [[major edition]]s, the latest printed in 2011. It is also available in an [[abridged version]] [suitable for smaller libraries]. OCLC, a [[non-profit cooperative]] 非营利合作社 that [serves libraries], currently [maintains the system]([[maintain the system]]) and [[license]]s [[online access]] to [[WebDewey]], [a continuously updated version]([[continuous update]]) for [[cataloger]]s.

- The Decimal Classification [introduced the concepts of] [[relative location]] and [[relative index]] which [allow new books to be added to a library] in their [[appropriate location]] based on [[subject]]. Libraries previously had given books permanent [[shelf location]]s that were related to [the order of acquisition] [rather than topic]. 
    - The classification's [[notation]] makes use of [three-digit numbers] for [[main class]]es, with [[fractional decimal]]s 小数 [allowing expansion for further detail]. [Numbers are flexible] [to the degree that] 灵活到此种程度 they [can be expanded in linear fashion] to [cover special aspects of general subjects].[2] A library assigns a [[classification number]] that unambiguously [locates a particular volume] 特定的卷 in a position [relative to other books in the library], on the basis of its subject. The number [makes it possible to] [find any book] and to return it to its [[proper place]] on the [[library shelves]].[Note 1] The [classification system] is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.[3][4]

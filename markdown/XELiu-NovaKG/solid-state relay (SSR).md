- A solid state relay (SSR) is an [electronic switching device]([[electronic switch]]) that [switches on or off] when an [[external voltage]] (AC or DC) is applied across its [[control terminal]]s. [It serves the same function as] an [[electromechanical relay]], but has no [[moving parts]] and [therefore results in a longer] [[operational lifetime]]. SSRs consist of a [[sensor]] which [responds to an appropriate input] ([[control signal]]), a solid-state electronic switching device which switches power to the load circuitry, and a coupling mechanism to enable the control signal to activate this switch without mechanical parts. The relay may be designed to switch either AC or DC loads.
    - Packaged solid-state relays use power semiconductor devices such as thyristors and transistors, to switch currents up to around a hundred amperes. Solid-state relays have fast switching speeds compared with electromechanical relays, and have no physical contacts to wear out. Users of solid-state relays must take into consideration an SSR's inability to withstand a large momentary overload the way an electromechanical relay can, as well as their higher "on" resistance.

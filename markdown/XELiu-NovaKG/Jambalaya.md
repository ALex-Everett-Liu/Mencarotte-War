    - Good-bye Joe, he gotta go, me oh my oh 
He gotta go-pole the pirogue down the bayou / 撑着独木舟, 顺河而下
His Yvonne the sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Thibodaux, Fontaineaux the place is buzzin' / 这里充满欢乐的声音
A kin-folk come to see Yvonne by the dozen / 亲友们成群结队
Dress in style the go hog wild, me oh my oh / 尽情作乐
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo / 什锦菜, 小龙虾派, 里脊秋葵
Cause tonight, I'm gonna see my ma cher a mi-o / 我将见到我的爱人
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o / 装满水果罐子, 好不快活
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou 
        - 我的老天; 好不快活
小坏蛋
    - Settle down far from town get him a pirogue
And he'll [catch all the fish]([[catch fish]]) in the bayou
Swap his mon to buy Yvonne what she need-o 
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Cause tonight, I'm gonna see my ma cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
        - 用他的的票子去买 Yvonne 想要的东西
    - Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Cause tonight, I'm gonna see my ma cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Cause tonight, I'm gonna see my ma cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Cause tonight, I'm gonna see my ma cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

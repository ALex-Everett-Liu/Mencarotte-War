- Measure problem (cosmology)
    - Not to be confused with [Measurement problem].
- The measure problem in cosmology concerns [how to compute] [fractions of universes of different types] within a [[multiverse]]. It typically [arises in the context of] [[eternal inflation]]. [The problem arises because] [different approaches to calculating] these fractions [yield different results], and [it's not clear] which approach (if any) is correct.[1]

    - Measures [can be evaluated by] whether they predict [observed physical constants], as well as whether they [avoid counterintuitive implications], 违反直觉的暗示 such as the [[youngness paradox]] or [[Boltzmann brain]]s.[2] While dozens of measures [have been proposed],[3]:2 few physicists [consider the problem to be solved].[4]
- The problem
    - [Infinite multiverse theories]([[infinite multiverse theories]]) are [becoming increasingly popular], but because they involve [infinitely many instances of different types of universes], it's unclear how to compute [the fractions of each type of universe](((1i6qhRxQ8))).[4] [[Alan Guth]] put it this way:[4]
        - In a single universe, [cows born with two heads] are rarer than [cows born with one head]. ^^[But in an infinitely branching multiverse] there are [an infinite number of] [one-headed cows]^^ and an infinite number of two-headed cows. What happens to the [[ratio]]?

    - [[Sean M. Carroll]] offered another [informal example]:[1]
        - Say there are an infinite number of universes in which George W. Bush became President in 2000, and also an infinite number in which Al Gore became President in 2000. To calculate the fraction N(Bush)/N(Gore), we need to have a measure — a way of taming those infinities. Usually this is done by “regularization.” We start with a small piece of universe where all the numbers are finite, calculate the fraction, and then let our piece get bigger, and calculate the limit that our fraction approaches.

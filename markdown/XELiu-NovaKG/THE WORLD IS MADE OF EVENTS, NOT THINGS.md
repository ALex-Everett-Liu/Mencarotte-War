- O gentlemen, the time of life is short . . .
And if we live, we live to tread on kings. 放在我们足下践踏
—— Shakespeare, Henry IV, Part I (act 5, scene 2)
- [Thinking of the world as] [a collection of events], of processes, [is the way that allows us to] better grasp, comprehend, and describe it. [It is the only way that] is [compatible with relativity]. [The world is not] [a collection of things], it is a collection of events.
    - [The difference between things and events is that] things [persist in time]; events have a [limited duration]. A stone is a prototypical “thing”: [we can ask ourselves] [where it will be tomorrow]. Conversely, a kiss is an “event.” [It makes no sense to ask] where the kiss will be tomorrow. [The world is made up of] networks of kisses, not of stones.

- The [basic units] in terms of which we [comprehend the world] are not [located in some specific point in space]. They are—if they are at all—in a where [but also in a when]. They are spatially but also [temporally delimited]: they are [[event]]s.

“Meet the new [Stephen Hawking] . . . The Order of Time is [a dazzling book].” —The Sunday Times

From the [bestselling author](((eg-ciXBI4))) of Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, a concise, elegant exploration of time.


    - Why do we [remember the past] and not the future? [What does it mean for] time to “flow”? Do we [exist in time] or does [time exist in us]? In lyric, accessible prose, Carlo Rovelli [invites us to] [consider questions about] [the nature of time] that [continue to puzzle] physicists and philosophers alike.

[For most readers] this is [unfamiliar terrain]. [We all experience] time, but the more scientists [learn about it], the more mysterious it remains. We think of it as uniform and universal, moving steadily [from past to future], measured by clocks. Rovelli [tears down these assumptions] one by one, [revealing a strange universe] where [at the most fundamental level] [time disappears]. He explains how the theory of quantum gravity attempts to understand and [give meaning to] the resulting [extreme landscape] 极端景观 of this [timeless world]. Weaving together ideas from philosophy, science and literature, [he suggests that] [our perception of] [the flow of time] [depends on our perspective], [better understood starting from] [the structure of our brain] and emotions than from the [physical universe].

        - Already a bestseller in Italy, and written with the [poetic vitality] 诗意活力 that made __Seven Brief Lessons on Physics__ so appealing, __The Order of Time__ offers a profoundly intelligent, culturally rich, novel appreciation of the mysteries of time.

    - ## PERHAPS TIME IS THE GREATEST MYSTERY
        - Even the words that [we are speaking now]
thieving time
has stolen away,
and nothing can return. (I, 11)
        - In [[Hindu mythology]], [the river of the cosmos] is portrayed with the [sacred image] of [Shiva dancing]: his dance [supports the coursing of the universe]; 宇宙的运行 it is itself [the flowing of time]. [What could be more] [universal and obvious] than this flowing?

        - [And yet things are somewhat] [more complicated than this]. [[reality]] is [often very different from] [what it seems]. [The Earth appears to be flat] but is in fact spherical. The sun seems to [revolve in the sky] [when it is really we who are spinning]. Neither is [the structure of time] [what it seems to be]: it is different from this uniform, universal flowing. I discovered this, to my utter astonishment, in the [physics books] I read [as a university student]: time [works quite differently from] [the way it seems to].

            - To my utter astonishment, she said it was because [it made her feel stupid]. www.[antpedia].com
            - In those same books [I also discovered that] [we still don’t know] [how time actually works]. The nature of time is perhaps [the greatest remaining mystery]. [Curious threads] connect it to those other [great open mysteries]: the nature of mind, the origin of the universe, the fate of black holes, [the very functioning of] [life on Earth]. [Something essential] continues to [draw us back to] [the nature of time](((9x_zRFN_B))).

        - Wonder is the source of our [desire for knowledge], 1 and the discovery that time is [not what we thought it was] [opens up a thousand questions]. The nature of time [has been at the center of] [my life’s work] in [theoretical physics]. In the following pages, I [give an account of] [what we have understood about] time and [the paths that are being followed] in our search to [understand it better], as well as an account of [what we have yet to understand] and [what it seems to me that] we are [just beginning to glimpse].

            - [1]: Aristotle, __Metaphysics__ I.2.982.
        - The third part of the book is [the most difficult], but also the [most vital] and the one that [most closely involves us]. In a world without time, [there must still be something that] [gives rise to the time] [that we are accustomed to], with its order, with its past that is [different from the future], with its [smooth flowing](((UQ4yO63do))). Somehow, our time must [emerge around us], at least for us and [at our scale]. 3
            - This is the [return journey], back toward the time lost in the first part of the book when pursuing [the elementary grammar of the world]. As in a [[crime novel]], we are now [going in search of] a [guilty party](((pj1v5pS4E))): the [[culprit]] who has [created time]. One by one, we discover the [constituent parts] of the time that is [familiar to us]—not, now, as [elementary structures] of reality, but rather as [useful approximations]([[approximation]]) for the [clumsy and bungling mortal creatures] 笨拙的凡人 we are: aspects of our perspective, and aspects, too, perhaps, that are decisive in [determining what we are]. Because the mystery of time is ultimately, perhaps, [more about ourselves] than [about the cosmos]. Perhaps, as in [the first and greatest of all] [[detective novel]]s, Sophocles’ [[Oedipus Rex]], the culprit [turns out to be] the detective.

            - [3]: The [[philosopher]] [Mauro Dorato] [has insisted on the necessity to] render the [elementary conceptual framework of physics] [coherent with our experience]; see Mauro Dorato, __Che cos’è il tempo?__ (Rome: Carocci, 2013).
        - Here, the book becomes [a fiery magma of ideas], 思想的炽热岩浆 sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing. If you decide to follow me, [I will take you to where] I believe [our knowledge of time] has reached: [up to the brink of] that [vast nocturnal and star-studded ocean] 广阔夜空星海的边缘 of [all that we still don’t know].

        - Inspired by https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git
    - Roam-to-git has [offered me great peace of mind] [knowing my Roam data is safe]. However, my backups [regularly failed] with [unknown errors] [multiple times a week]. People were emailing me [with the same issues], and I couldn't help. Then [it got to the point] on 2021-01-28 where all my backups were failing. Roam-to-git's creator didn't seem active with [addressing the issues](((23-g_XxGE))), and I don't know enough Python [fix his code]. So I decided to write my own [backup solution] from scratch using Node— with [clearer logging] to make [[troubleshooting]] easier.
    - ## Differences from roam-to-git
        - Uses [[Node]] (rather than Python)
        - Supports [[EDN]] in addition to [[JSON]] and [[Markdown]] (not [[formatted markdown]] though)
        - [Multiple graph backups] [in the same repo]
        - __Better [error debugging] and [active support] from the developer__ (Erik Newhard @everruler12) to get your backups [running smoothly] and error-free
    - ## Future Plans
        -  New, [full guide] with step-by-step [[screen recording]]s
        -  Update code to [[run asynchronously]], instead of linearly, to [cut down on run time]
        -  Use fipp for faster EDN formatting
        -  Allow [setup of public repo] for running Actions and [committing to private repo] for backup, in order to [bypass minute limit] for [private GitHub Actions].

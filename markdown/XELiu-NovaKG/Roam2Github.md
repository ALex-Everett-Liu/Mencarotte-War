        - Inspired by https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git
    - Roam-to-git has [offered me great peace of mind] [knowing my Roam data is safe]. However, my backups [regularly failed] with [unknown errors] [multiple times a week]. People were emailing me [with the same issues], and I couldn't help. Then [it got to the point] on 2021-01-28 where all my backups were failing. Roam-to-git's creator didn't seem active with [addressing the issues](((23-g_XxGE))), and I don't know enough Python [fix his code]. So I decided to write my own [backup solution] from scratch using Node— with [clearer logging] to make [[troubleshooting]] easier.
    - ## Differences from roam-to-git
        - Uses [[Node]] (rather than Python)
        - Supports [[EDN]] in addition to [[JSON]] and [[Markdown]] (not [[formatted markdown]] though)
        - [Multiple graph backups] [in the same repo]
        - __Better [error debugging] and [active support] from the developer__ (Erik Newhard @everruler12) to get your backups [running smoothly] and error-free
    - ## Future Plans
        -  New, [full guide] with step-by-step [[screen recording]]s
        -  Update code to [[run asynchronously]], instead of linearly, to [cut down on run time]
        -  Use fipp for faster EDN formatting
        -  Allow [setup of public repo] for running Actions and [committing to private repo] for backup, in order to [bypass minute limit] for [private GitHub Actions].
        - ---
        -  EDN support (2021-01-31)
        -  Multi graph support (2021-02-01)
        -  Markdown support (2021-02-04)
    - ## EDN Backups are live!
        - The backup [has a check to make sure] the formatted EDN (which only adds extra [[linebreak]]s and [[indentation]]) [can be parsed back] to 被解析为 [match exactly with] the original [before saving it]. It will [exit with an error] if it can't, so you can rest assured that the formatting doesn't mess with the [[file integrity]]. 文件的完整性 I also tested that the formatted EDN can be used to [successfully restore graphs]().
        - 2021-01-31 [It took all day to figure out] how to use [[ClojureScript]] to prettify EDN. It was [a daunting task], never having dealt with Clojure before, much less [compiling it into]([[compile]]) [[JavaScript]]. But I did it! This is necessary because the [exported EDN data] from Roam is [[all in one line]], ^^meaning GitHub would have to [save the entire file] each time, instead of [just the new lines].^^ This would [eat up the storage] pretty quickly if [run every hour], as [unchanged notes] would be [duplicated each time]. And you [wouldn't be able to see] [[line-by-line changes]] in the [[git history]].
    - ## Multi Graph Backups in Same Repo
        - You can now backup multiple graphs [without having to] create a new GitHub repo for each one. Just add them to your `R2G_GRAPH` Secret [in separate lines], or [separated by commas].

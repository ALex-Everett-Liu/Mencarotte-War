- In [[electromagnetics]], an evanescent field, or evanescent wave, is an [oscillating electric and/or magnetic field] that does not propagate as an [[electromagnetic wave]] but whose energy is [spatially concentrated] [in the vicinity of the source] (oscillating charges and currents). Even when there is a [propagating electromagnetic wave] produced (e.g., by a [[transmitting antenna]]), one can still identify as an evanescent field [the component of the electric or magnetic field] that [cannot be attributed to the] [[propagating wave]] observed at a distance of many wavelengths (such as the [[far field]] of a transmitting antenna).

    - A hallmark of an evanescent field is that there is no [[net energy flow]] in that region. Since the net flow of electromagnetic energy is given by the average Poynting vector, this means that the Poynting vector in these regions, as averaged over a complete oscillation cycle, is zero.[note 1]

- In [[electromagnetics]], an evanescent field, or evanescent wave, is an [oscillating electric and/or magnetic field] that does not propagate as an [[electromagnetic wave]] but whose energy is [spatially concentrated] [in the vicinity of the source] (oscillating charges and currents). Even when there is a [propagating electromagnetic wave] produced (e.g., by a [[transmitting antenna]]), one can still identify as an evanescent field [the component of the electric or magnetic field] that [cannot be attributed to the] [[propagating wave]] observed at a distance of many wavelengths (such as the [[far field]] of a transmitting antenna).

    - A hallmark of an evanescent field is that there is no [[net energy flow]] in that region. Since the net flow of [[electromagnetic energy]] is given by the [[average Poynting vector]], this means that the Poynting vector in these regions, as averaged over a complete [[oscillation cycle]], is zero.[note 1](((bivNh6DJ6)))

[The fields away from the surface] [die off exponentially] (right hand graph) and those fields are thus [described as evanescent] [in the z direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electron_density_wave_-_plasmon_excitations.png)

        - The charge density oscillations and associated [[electromagnetic field]]s are called surface plasmon-polariton waves. The [[exponential dependence]] of the [electromagnetic field intensity] on [the distance away from the interface] is [shown on the right]. [These waves can be excited] [very efficiently] with light [in the visible range of](((it-L_cjdx))) the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].
        - Presently, [[metallic nanostructure]]s are used to fabricate/analyze:
            - [[sub-diffraction limit]] [[optical waveguide]]s based on [[metallic nanoparticle array]]s and [[nanowire]]s.

    - [1]: Or, expressing the fields **E** and **H** as [[phasor]]s, the complex Poynting vector $${\displaystyle \mathbf {S} =\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {H} ^{*}}$$ has a zero real part.

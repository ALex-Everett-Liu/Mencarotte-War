- [A quantum mechanical system or particle] that is [bound]([[bound system]])—that is, [confined spatially](((of4TUG4vy)))—can only take on certain [[discrete value]]s of energy, called energy levels. This contrasts with [[classical particle]]s, which can have [any amount of energy]. [The term is commonly used for] the energy levels of [the electrons in atoms], ions, or molecules, which are bound by [the electric field of the nucleus](((9Gt5z4_Jb))), [but can also refer to] [energy levels of nuclei](((GnzISWLMe))) or [[vibrational energy level]] or [[rotational energy level]]s in molecules. The [[energy spectrum]] of a system with such [discrete energy levels] is said to be [[quantized]].

    - In chemistry and atomic physics, an [[electron shell]], or [[principal energy level]], may be thought of as [the orbit of one or more electrons]([[electron orbit]]) [around an atom's nucleus]([[atomic nucleus]]). [The closest shell to the nucleus] is called the "1 shell" (also called "K shell"), followed by the "2 shell" (or "L shell"), then the "3 shell" (or "M shell"), and so on [farther and farther from] the nucleus. The shells correspond with the [[principal quantum number]]s (n = 1, 2, 3, 4 ...) or are [labeled alphabetically with letters used in] the [[X-ray notation]] (K, L, M, N…).
        - Each shell can contain only [a fixed number of electrons]: The first shell [can hold up to two electrons], the second shell can hold up to eight (2 + 6) electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18 (2 + 6 + 10) and so on. The [general formula] is that the [nth shell] [can in principle hold up to] 2(n2) electrons.[1] Since electrons are [electrically attracted to the nucleus], an atom's electrons will generally [occupy outer shells] only if the [more inner shells] have already been [completely filled by] other electrons. However, this is not a [strict requirement]: atoms may have two or even three [incomplete outer shells](((LCeVyQOIG))). (See Madelung rule for more details.) [For an explanation of] why electrons [exist in these shells] see electron configuration.[2]

    - If the [[potential energy]] is [set to zero at infinite distance] [from the atomic nucleus] or molecule, the usual convention, then [bound electron states]([[bound state]]) have [[negative potential energy]].
    - If an atom, ion, or molecule is at the lowest possible energy level, it and its electrons are said to be in the ground state. If it is at a higher energy level, it is said to be excited, or any electrons that have higher energy than the ground state are excited. If more than one quantum mechanical state is at the same energy, the energy levels are "degenerate". They are then called degenerate energy levels.

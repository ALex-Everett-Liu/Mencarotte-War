- Remember that expressions are just [values combined with operators], and they always [evaluate down to a single value]. A [[data type]] is a [[category]] for values, and [every value belongs to] [exactly one data type]. The most common data types in Python are [listed in Table 1-2]. The values -2 and 30 , for example, are said to be [[integer value]]s. The integer (or [[int]]) data type indicates values that are [[whole number]]s. Numbers with a [[decimal point]], such as 3.14 , are called [[floating-point number]]s (or [[floats]]). Note that even though the value 42 is an integer, the value 42.0 would be a floating-point number.

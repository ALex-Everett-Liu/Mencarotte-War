- A fiber-optic sensor is a sensor that uses [[optical fiber]] either as the [[sensing element]] ("[[intrinsic sensor]]s"), or [as a means of] [[relaying signals]] from a [[remote sensor]] to the [[electronics]] that [process the signals]([[signal processing]]) ("[[extrinsic sensor]]s"). 从远程传感器到电子设备的信号中继 Fibers have many uses in [[remote sensing]]. 
    - Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, or because no [[electrical power]] is needed at the [[remote location]], or because many sensors can be [[multiplexed]] 复用 [along the length of a fiber] by using light [[wavelength shift]] for each sensor, or by sensing the [[time delay]] as [light passes along the fiber] [through each sensor]. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an [[optical time-domain reflectometer]] and wavelength shift can be calculated using an instrument implementing [[optical frequency domain reflectometry]]. 反射仪
- Fiber-optic sensors are also immune to electromagnetic interference, and do not conduct electricity so they can be used in places where there is high voltage electricity or flammable material such as jet fuel. Fiber-optic sensors can be designed to withstand high temperatures as well.

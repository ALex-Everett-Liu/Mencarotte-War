- [[large-scale collaboration]] requires a more flexible [[data structure]] than the classic [[file tree]]. Roam is built on a [[knowledge graph]] that [maps all possible relationships](((4VG5J1QQH))), with ‘smart’ links between [[defined concept]]s. Users can [connect similar ideas]([[connect ideas]]) in [multiple overlapping hierarchies]([[overlapping hierarchy]]), [[remix ideas]] without overwriting the [[original context]], and [selectively share parts of the graph with others]([[selective sharing]]) to collaborate on [[specific sub-question]]s. 
- If [current tools] resemble [filing cabinets], Roam is more akin to the [[nodal network]]s in [[telecommunication]]s, or the [neurons] in the [[human brain]]. Rather than [existing in a vacuum]([[vacuum]]), [each note or file] [becomes a node in] an [interconnected graph of ideas].

    - [A single node] may [simultaneously hold positions in]([[position]]) several [different sequences]([[sequence]]), [hierarchies]([[hierarchy]]) or [[file path]]s, and can ‘talk’ to other nodes, [communicating information back and forth]([[information communication]]) about [the nature of each relationship]. 多位置属性
        - The network is [dynamic]([[dynamic network]]), so [[update]]s and [[revision]]s are [populated across the entire graph simultaneously]([[populate changes]]). 
        - [Individual nodes] or [[branch]]es [within the network] [can be forked as required]([[fork]]), allowing a [new pathway]([[pathway]]) to [deviate](((mSKcBgYeE))) [without changing the original meaning]([[original meaning]]).
    - [At the simplest level], Roam’s structure [makes it inherently easier to](((Xt-z5MCz8))) store, [recall](((gxUoOqFib))), and [[cross-reference]] ideas. This is the [[primary proposition]] for [[student]]s, [[writer]]s, [[self-directed learner]]s, and users of existing [[note-taking app]]s.

        - For [[power user]]s, the [knowledge graph] also [unlocks applications in] [[logic]] and [[reasoning]], [[Bayesian inference]] and [[decision-making]], [[modelling]] [[complex problem]]s, and [[collaborative research]].
    - These features are explored in [Chapters]([[chapter]]) 5 - 8, along with potential [[use case]]s for the [technology].

- [[large-scale collaboration]] requires a more flexible [[data structure]] than the classic [[file tree]]. Roam is built on a [[knowledge graph]] that [maps all possible relationships], with ‘smart’ links between [[defined concept]]s. Users can [connect similar ideas]([[connect ideas]]) in [[multiple overlapping hierarchies]], [[remix ideas]] without overwriting the [[original context]], and [selectively share parts of the graph with others]([[selective sharing]]) to collaborate on [[specific sub-question]]s.

- [[large-scale collaboration]] requires a more flexible [[data structure]] than the classic [[file tree]]. Roam is built on a [[knowledge graph]] that [maps all possible relationships], with ‘smart’ links between [[defined concept]]s. Users can [connect similar ideas]([[connect ideas]]) in [multiple overlapping hierarchies]([[overlapping hierarchy]]), [[remix ideas]] without overwriting the [[original context]], and [selectively share parts of the graph with others]([[selective sharing]]) to collaborate on [[specific sub-question]]s. 
- If [current tools] resemble [filing cabinets], Roam is more akin to the [[nodal network]]s in [[telecommunication]]s, or the [neurons] in the [[human brain]]. Rather than [existing in a vacuum]([[vacuum]]), [each note or file] [becomes a node in] an [interconnected graph of ideas].

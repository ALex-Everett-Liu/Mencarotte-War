- Dances of love intertwine
such graceful girls
lit by the moon
on these clear nights. (I, 4)
- ### THE SLOWING DOWN OF TIME
    - [Let’s begin with] [a simple fact]: [time passes faster] [in the mountains] than it does [at sea level].
        - [The difference is small] but [can be measured with precision timepieces]([[timepiece]]) that [can be bought today on the internet] [for a few thousand dollars]. With practice, [anyone can witness] [the slowing down of time](((jK4mdASIM))). With the timepieces of [specialized laboratories], this slowing down of time [can be detected] [between levels just a few centimeters apart]: [a clock placed on the floor] [runs a little more slowly than] [one on a table].

        - It is not just the clocks that slow down: lower down, all processes are slower. Two friends separate, with one of them [living in the plains] and the other [going to live in the mountains]. [They meet up again] [years later]: the one who has [stayed down] [has lived less], aged less, the mechanism of his [cuckoo clock] has [oscillated fewer times]. He has had less time to do things, his plants have grown less, his thoughts have had less time to unfold. . . . Lower down, there is simply less time than [at altitude].

    - The ability to [understand something] [before it’s observed] is [at the heart of scientific thinking]. In antiquity, [[Anaximander]] understood that [the sky continues beneath our feet] long before [ships had circumnavigated the Earth](((eXuNa0VXi))). At the beginning of the modern era, Copernicus understood that the Earth turns long before astronauts had seen it do so from the moon. In a similar way, Einstein understood that time does not pass uniformly everywhere before the development of clocks accurate enough to measure the different speeds at which it passes.

        - In the course of [making such strides], [we learn that] the things that [seemed self-evident to us] [were really no more than prejudices]. [It seemed obvious that] [the sky was above us] and not below; otherwise, the Earth would fall down. It seemed self-evident that [the Earth did not move]; otherwise, it would [cause everything to crash]. [That time passed at the same speed everywhere] [seemed equally obvious to us]. . . . [Children grow up] and discover that [the world is not as it seemed from] [within the four walls of their homes]. [Humankind as a whole] [does the same].
211205-20:14
    - Einstein [asked himself a question] that has perhaps [puzzled many of us] when studying [the force of gravity]: how can [the sun and the Earth] [“attract” each other without touching] and [without utilizing anything between them]?
        - He [looked for a plausible explanation] and found one [by imagining that] the sun and the Earth [do not attract each other directly] but that [each of the two] [gradually acts on that which is between them]. And since [what lies between them] is [only space and time], he imagined that the sun and the Earth each [modified the space and time that surrounded them], just as [a body immersed in water] [displaces the water around it]. [This modification of the structure of time] influences in turn the movement of bodies, causing them to [“fall” toward each other]. 4
(既然两者之间相隔的仅仅是时空，那么它们就必然通过改变时空来施加相互作用，从而传递引力)
            - [4] [This is the essence of] the theory of [[general relativity]]. Albert Einstein, “Die Grundlage der algemeinen Relativitätstheorie,” __Annalen der Physik__ 49 (1916): 769–822.
    - Hence, even though we [cannot easily observe it], the slowing down of time nevertheless has [crucial effects]: things fall because of it, and it allows us to [keep our feet firmly on the ground]. If our feet [adhere to the pavement], ^^it is because [our whole body inclines naturally to where] [time runs more slowly]—and [time passes more slowly] for your feet [than it does for your head].^^
(某位置的时间运行的越缓慢，此处对周围的吸引力就越强)
211205-20:36
        - Does this seem strange? It is like when, [watching the sun going down gloriously] at sunset, [disappearing slowly] [behind distant clouds], [we suddenly remember that] [it’s not the sun that’s moving] [but the Earth that’s spinning], and we see with [the unhinged eye of the mind] our [entire planet]—and ourselves with it—rotating backward, away from the sun. We are seeing with [“mad” eyes], like those of [Paul McCartney’s] [Fool on the Hill]: the [crazed vision] that [sometimes sees further than] [our bleary, customary eyesight]. 朦胧的、习惯性的/惯常的

- ### TEN THOUSAND DANCING SHIVAS
    - The question is meaningless. [We might just as well ask] [what is most real]—the value of sterling in dollars or [the value of dollars in sterling]. There is no “truer” value; they are two currencies that [have value relative to each other]. There is no “truer” time; there are two times and [they change relative to each other]. Neither is truer than the other.
        - But there are not just two times. Times are legion: a different one for [every point in space]. There is not one single time; there is [a vast multitude of] them.
        - The time [indicated by a particular clock] [measuring a particular phenomenon] is called “[[proper time]]” in physics. Every clock has its proper time. [Every phenomenon that occurs] has its proper time, its own [[rhythm]].
211205-22:42
            - Einstein [has given us the equations that describe] [how proper times develop relative to each other]. [He has shown us how to] [calculate the difference between two times]. 7
                - [7]: For example: (t table − t ground ) = gh/c^2 t_ground where c is the [[speed of light]], g = 9.8m/s2 is [the acceleration of Galileo](((6XHanbVA_))), and h is [the height of the table].
    - [The single quantity] “time” [melts into a spiderweb of times]. [We do not describe] [how the world evolves in time]: we describe [how things evolve in] [[local time]], and how local times [evolve relative to each other]. [The world is not like] a platoon [advancing at the pace of] [a single commander]. 排长 It’s [a network of events](((747goeWwQ))) [affecting each other].
211205-22:50
        - This is [how time is depicted in] Einstein’s [[general theory of relativity]]. His equations [do not have a single “time”]; they have [innumerable times]. Between two events, just as [between the two clocks] that are separated and [then brought together again], the duration is not a single one. 8 [Physics does not describe] [how things evolve “in time”] but [how things evolve in their own times], and how “times” evolve relative to each other.*
            - [8]: [They can also be written with] [a single variable], t, the “[[temporal coordinate]],” but this does not indicate the time [measured by a clock] (determined by ds, not by dt) and [may be changed arbitrarily] [without changing the world described]. This t [does not represent] a [[physical quantity]]. [What clocks measure] is the proper time [along a line of the universe] γ, given by $$t_{\gamma}=\int_{\gamma} \vee g_{a b}(x) d x^{a} d x^{b}$$ (t γ = ∫ γ √ g ab (x)dx a dx b). [The physical relation between this quantity] and g ab (x) is [discussed further on].
211205-23:13
            - * Grammatical note: The word “time” [has several meanings] [linked to each other] but [distinct from one another]: 1. “Time” is [the general phenomenon of] [the succession of events] (“[The inaudible and noiseless foot] of time”); 2. “Time” indicates an interval in this succession (“To morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow, /Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, /To the last syllable of recorded time”); or 3. its duration (“O gentlemen, the time of life is short”); 4. “Time” can also indicate a particular moment (“Time will come and take my love away”; often the current one (“The time is out of joint”); 6. “Time” indicates the variable that [measures duration] (“Acceleration is [the derivative of speed] [with respect to time]”). In this book, I employ each of these meanings freely, just as [in common usage]. In case of any confusion, please refer back to this note.
    - Time has lost [its first aspect or layer]: its [[unity]]. It has [a different rhythm] [in every different place] and [passes here differently from there]. The things of this world interweave dances made to different rhythms. If [the world is upheld by] the dancing Shiva, there must be ten thousand such dancing Shivas, like the [dancing figures] painted by Matisse. . . .

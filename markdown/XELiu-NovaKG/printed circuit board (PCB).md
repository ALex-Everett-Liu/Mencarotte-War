- A printed circuit board (PCB) [mechanically supports] and [electrically connects] [[electronic component]]s using [[conductive track]]s, [[conductive pad]]s and other features [etched from one or more sheet layers of copper](((CDa9nRNMB))) [laminated onto](((eUFU2vtjx))) and/or between [[sheet layer]]s of a [[non-conductive substrate]]. Components are generally [soldered onto the PCB](((wbdGBdMS_))) to both [electrically connect] and [mechanically fasten them to it].

    - Printed circuit boards are [used in all but the simplest] [[electronic product]]s. 除最简单的电子产品外 They are also used in some [[electrical product]]s, such as [[passive switch box]]es. 
    - Alternatives to PCBs include [[wire wrap]] and [[point-to-point construction]], both [once popular] [but now rarely used]. PCBs [require additional design effort] to [lay out the circuit], but [manufacturing and assembly] [can be automated]. [Electronic computer-aided design software]([[electronic computer-aided design (ECAD)]]) is [available to do much of the work] of layout. [Mass-producing circuits] with PCBs is [cheaper and faster than] with other [[wiring method]]s, as components are [mounted and wired in one operation]. Large numbers of PCBs [can be fabricated at the same time], and the layout [only has to be done once]. PCBs [can also be made manually] [in small quantities], [with reduced benefits].

    - PCBs can be single-sided (one [[copper layer]]), double-sided (two copper layers on both sides of one [[substrate layer]]), or multi-layer ([outer and inner layers] of copper, alternating with [layers of substrate]). [[multi-layer PCB]]s [allow for much higher] [[component density]], because [circuit traces on the inner layers](((0K82fXvLG))) would otherwise [take up surface space between components]. [The rise in popularity of] multilayer PCBs with more than two, and especially with more than four, [[copper plane]]s was [concurrent with the adoption of] [[surface mount technology]]. However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and [[field modification]] of circuits [much more difficult] and usually impractical.
    - The [[world market]] for [bare PCBs] exceeded $60.2 billion in 2014[1] and is [estimated to reach] $79 billion by 2024.[2][3]

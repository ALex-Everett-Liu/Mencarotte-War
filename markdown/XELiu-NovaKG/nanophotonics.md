- Nanophotonics or nano-optics is the study of [the behavior of light](((BDKEiMXd8))) on the [[nanometer scale]], and of the interaction of [nanometer-scale objects](((kx5fQo1pK))) with light. It is a branch of optics, [[optical engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering (EE)]], and [[nanotechnology]]. It often involves [[dielectric structure]]s such as [[nanoantennas]], or [[metallic component]]s, [which can](((_vUPsWUkd))) [transport and focus light]([[focus light]]) via [[surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)]].

    - The term "[[nano-optics]]", just like the term "optics", [usually refers to situations involving] ultraviolet, visible, and [near-infrared light](((NLaqwfkHl))) ([[free-space wavelength]]s from 300 to 1200 nanometers).
- Background
    - Normal [[optical component]]s, like [lenses]([[lens]]) and [[microscope]]s, generally cannot normally [focus light to nanometer] (deep subwavelength) scales, because of the [[diffraction limit]] ([[Rayleigh criterion]]). Nevertheless, [it is possible to] [squeeze light] into a [nanometer scale] [using other techniques like], for example, [[surface plasmon]]s, [[localized surface plasmons (LSPs)]] around [nanoscale metal objects](((kx5fQo1pK))), and the [[nanoscale aperture]]s and [[nanoscale sharp tip]]s used in [[near-field scanning optical microscopy]] (SNOM or NSOM)[1][2][3] and [photoassisted](((AatRkXJhg))) [[scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM)]].[4]

- Motivations
    - Nanophotonics researchers [pursue a very wide variety of goals], [in fields ranging from] [[biochemistry]] to electrical engineering. A few of these goals are [summarized below].
    - [Solar cells]([[solar cell]]) [often work best when] [the light is absorbed]([[light absorption]]) [very close to the surface], both because electrons [near the surface] [have a better chance of being collected](((nw0GsQ0jz))), and because the device [can be made thinner], which [reduces cost](((QbKIKNKx7))). Researchers have [investigated a variety of nanophotonic techniques to] [intensify light in the optimal locations] [within a solar cell].[12]

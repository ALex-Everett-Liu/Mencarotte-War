- Nanophotonics or nano-optics is the study of [the behavior of light](((BDKEiMXd8))) on the [[nanometer scale]], and of the interaction of [nanometer-scale objects](((kx5fQo1pK))) with light. It is a branch of optics, [[optical engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering (EE)]], and [[nanotechnology]]. It often involves [[dielectric structure]]s such as [[nanoantennas]], or [[metallic component]]s, [which can](((_vUPsWUkd))) [transport and focus light]([[focus light]]) via [[surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)]].

    - The term "[[nano-optics]]", just like the term "optics", [usually refers to situations involving] ultraviolet, visible, and [near-infrared light](((NLaqwfkHl))) ([[free-space wavelength]]s from 300 to 1200 nanometers).
- Background
    - Normal [[optical component]]s, like [lenses]([[lens]]) and [[microscope]]s, generally cannot normally [focus light to nanometer] ([deep subwavelength](((K7t9bzAIv)))) scales, because of the [[diffraction limit]] ([[Rayleigh criterion]]). Nevertheless, [it is possible to] [squeeze light](((dOagL4VFk))) into a [nanometer scale] [using other techniques like], for example, [[surface plasmon]]s, [[localized surface plasmons (LSPs)]] around [nanoscale metal objects](((kx5fQo1pK))), and the [[nanoscale aperture]]s and [[nanoscale sharp tip]]s used in [[near-field scanning optical microscopy]] (SNOM or NSOM)[1](((2tWT03OkJ)))[2][3] and [photoassisted](((AatRkXJhg))) [[scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM)]].[4]

- Motivations
    - Nanophotonics researchers [pursue a very wide variety of goals], [in fields ranging from] [[biochemistry]] to electrical engineering. A few of these goals are [summarized below].
    - [Solar cells]([[solar cell]]) [often work best when] [the light is absorbed]([[light absorption]]) [very close to the surface], both because electrons [near the surface] [have a better chance of being collected](((nw0GsQ0jz))), and because the device [can be made thinner], which [reduces cost](((QbKIKNKx7))). Researchers have [investigated a variety of nanophotonic techniques to] [intensify light in the optimal locations] [within a solar cell].[12]

        - Metals are [an effective way to] [confine light to](((5ce75P67N))) [far below the wavelength](((K7t9bzAIv))). This was originally used in [[radio engineering]] and [[microwave engineering]], where [[metal antenna]]s and [[waveguide]]s may be [hundreds of times smaller than] the [[free-space wavelength]]. For a similar reason, [[visible light]] [can be confined to the nano-scale] via [nano-sized metal structures](((zw20fCzMV))), such as nano-sized structures, tips, gaps, etc. Many [nano-optics designs] look like common [[microwave circuit]] or [[radiowave circuit]]s, but [shrunk down by a factor of] 100,000 or more. After all, radiowaves, microwaves, and visible light are all [[electromagnetic radiation]]; they [differ only in frequency]. So other things equal, a microwave circuit shrunk down by a factor of 100,000 [will behave the same way] but at 100,000 times [higher frequency]. [15] [This effect is somewhat analogous to] a [[lightning rod]], where the field [concentrates at the tip].

            - The [technological field] that [makes use of] [the interaction between light and metals](((-cguDKDJx))) is called [[plasmonics]]. It is [fundamentally based on the fact that] the [[permittivity]] of the metal is very large and negative. [At very high frequencies] (near and above the [plasma frequency], usually ultraviolet), the permittivity of a metal is not so large, and the metal [stops being useful for] [concentrating fields](((dOagL4VFk))).
(当频率高到紫外波段时，金属的介电常数不再那么大，浓缩电磁场的能力减弱)
    - [Metamaterials]([[metamaterial]]) are [[artificial material]]s [engineered to have properties that] [may not be found in nature]. [They are created by] [fabricating an array of structures] [much smaller than a wavelength]. The small (nano) size of the structures is important: That way, [light interacts with them](((-cguDKDJx))) as if they made up a [[uniform medium]], [[continuous medium]], rather than [scattering off the individual structures].

- Buyeo or Puyŏ (Korean: 부여; Hanja: 夫餘 Korean pronunciation: [pu.jʌ]; Chinese: 夫餘; pinyin: Fūyú; Japanese: 扶余 Fuyo), was an [ancient kingdom] that was centered in [northern Manchuria] [in modern-day northeast China].
    - According to the Book of the Later Han, Buyeo was initially [placed under the jurisdiction of] the [Xuantu Commandery]([[玄菟郡 (Xuantu)]]),[1] one of [Four Commanderies of Han] in the later Western Han. Buyeo [entered into formal diplomatic relations with] the Eastern Han dynasty [by the mid-1st century AD] [as an important ally of that empire] to [check the Xianbei and Goguryeo threats]. Jurisdiction of Buyeo was then placed under the [Liaodong Commandery]([[辽东 (Liaodong)]]) of the Eastern Han.[2] 
        - After an incapacitating [Xianbei invasion](((HqAt2kQBR))) in 285, 军事失能 Buyeo was [restored with help from] the Jin dynasty. This, however, [marked the beginning of] [a period of decline]. A second Xianbei invasion in 346 [finally destroyed the state](((NpfX5_A_Z))), except some remnants in its [core region] which [survived as vassals of] [[高句丽 (Goguryeo)]] [until their final annexation in] 494.

    - Inhabitants of Buyeo included the [Yemaek tribe]([[濊貊 (Yemaek)]]).[3][4] According to the [Records of the Three Kingdoms], the Buyeo language was similar to those of [its southern neighbours] Goguryeo and Ye, and the language of [[沃沮 (Okjeo)]] was [only slightly different from them].[5] Both Goguryeo and Baekje, two of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, [considered themselves] Buyeo's successors.[citation needed]

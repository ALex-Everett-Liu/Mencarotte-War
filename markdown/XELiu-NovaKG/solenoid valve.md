- A [solenoid valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solonoid_valves.jpg) is an [electromechanically-operated valve].
    - Solenoid valves differ in the characteristics of the [[electric current]] they use, the strength of the [[magnetic field]] they generate, [the mechanism they use to] [regulate the fluid](((gTWN92-mX))), and [the type and characteristics of fluid] they control. The mechanism varies from linear action, plunger-type actuators 柱塞式执行器 to pivoted-armature actuators 枢轴电枢执行器 and rocker actuators. 摇臂执行器 The valve can use [a two-port design](((UiutzCc9x))) to regulate a flow or use [a three or more port design](((Iw67PXD7W))) to [switch flows between ports](((o7E0Xjbbo))). Multiple solenoid valves [can be placed together on a manifold]([[manifold]]). 一起放置在一个歧管上

    - Solenoid valves are the [most frequently used] [control elements in fluidics]([[fluidics]]). 射流/流体控制元件 Their tasks are to shut off, release, dose, (送药; 剂量) distribute or mix fluids. They are found [in many application areas]. Solenoids offer [fast and safe switching], high-[[reliability]], long [[service life]], good medium [[compatibility]] of the materials used, low control power and compact design.

- 工作原理
    - 通过对[电磁线圈]通电／断电控制管路的开启／关闭或改变流体（一般是[压缩空气]([[compressed air]])或者液体）流向（电磁开关阀）。
    - 改变通过电磁线圈电压／电流（[一般为电流]譬如4-20mA的[直流电流]）[等参数]控制管路中[流体流量]或流体压力（电磁调节阀）。
- Operation
    - There are many valve [design variations]. [Ordinary valves] [can have many ports] and [[fluid path]]s. A [[2-way valve]], for example, has 2 [[port]]s; if the valve is open, then [the two ports are connected] and fluid may [flow between the ports]; if the valve is closed, then ports are isolated. If the valve is open [when the solenoid is not energized](((kipz2ZEEv))), then the valve is termed [[normally open (N.O.)]]. Similarly, if the valve is closed when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed [[normally closed (N.C.)]].[1](((mJoden_SG))) There are also 3-way and [more complicated designs].[2] A [[3-way valve]] has 3 ports; it [connects one port to] [either of the two other ports] (typically a [[supply port]] and an [[exhaust port]]).

    - Solenoid valves are also characterized by [how they operate]. A small solenoid can [generate a limited force]. [An approximate relationship between] the [required solenoid force] Fs, the [[fluid pressure]] P, and the [[orifice area]] A for a [direct acting solenoid valve](((UiutzCc9x))) is:[3]

        - $${\displaystyle F_{s}=P*A=P\pi d^{2}/4}$$
        - Where d is the [[orifice diameter]]. A typical solenoid force might be 15 N (3.4 lbf). An application might be a low pressure (e.g., 10 psi (69 kPa)) gas [with a small orifice diameter] (e.g., 3⁄8 in (9.5 mm) for an orifice area of 0.11 in^2 (7.1×10^−5 m2) and [approximate force] of 1.1 lbf (4.9 N)).

    - Pilot-Operated
        - While there are multiple design variants, the following is a [detailed breakdown] of a typical [pilot-operated solenoid valve]. 先导型 They may use [[metal seal]]s or [[rubber seal]]s, 金属密封件 and may also have [[electrical interface]]s to [allow for easy control].
- Common uses
    - Solenoid valves are used in [[fluid power]] [[pneumatic system]] and [[hydraulic system]]s, to control [[cylinder]]s, 气缸 [[fluid power motor]]s 液压马达 or larger [[industrial valve]]s. [Automatic irrigation sprinkler systems](((r1uk9HKog))) also use solenoid valves with an [[automatic controller]]. [domestic washing machines]([[washing machine]]) 家用洗衣机 and [[dishwasher]]s [use solenoid valves to control] water [entry into the machine]. 控制进水量 They are also often used in [paintball gun triggers] 彩弹枪触发器 to actuate the [CO2 hammer valve]. 锤阀 Solenoid valves are [usually referred to simply as] "solenoids."

    - Solenoid valves [can be used for a wide array of] [[industrial application]]s, including general [[on-off control]], calibration and test stands, 校准和试验台 pilot plant control loops, 中试装置控制回路 [[process control system]]s, and various [original equipment manufacturer applications].[15](((v-om9wR4Y)))

- A [solenoid valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solonoid_valves.jpg) is an [electromechanically-operated valve].
    - Solenoid valves differ in the characteristics of the [[electric current]] they use, the strength of the [[magnetic field]] they generate, [the mechanism they use to] [regulate the fluid](((gTWN92-mX))), and [the type and characteristics of fluid] they control. The mechanism varies from linear action, plunger-type actuators 柱塞式执行器 to pivoted-armature actuators 枢轴电枢执行器 and rocker actuators. 摇臂执行器 The valve can use [a two-port design](((UiutzCc9x))) to regulate a flow or use [a three or more port design](((Iw67PXD7W))) to [switch flows between ports](((o7E0Xjbbo))). Multiple solenoid valves [can be placed together on a manifold]([[manifold]]). 一起放置在一个歧管上

    - Solenoid valves are the [most frequently used] [control elements in fluidics]([[fluidics]]). 射流/流体控制元件 Their tasks are to shut off, release, dose, (送药; 剂量) distribute or mix fluids. They are found [in many application areas]. Solenoids offer [fast and safe switching], high-[[reliability]], long [[service life]], good medium [[compatibility]] of the materials used, low control power and compact design.

- Operation
    - There are many valve design variations. Ordinary valves can have many ports and fluid paths. A 2-way valve, for example, has 2 ports; if the valve is open, then the two ports are connected and fluid may flow between the ports; if the valve is closed, then ports are isolated. If the valve is open when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed normally open (N.O.). Similarly, if the valve is closed when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed normally closed (N.C.).[1] There are also 3-way and more complicated designs.[2] A 3-way valve has 3 ports; it connects one port to either of the two other ports (typically a supply port and an exhaust port).

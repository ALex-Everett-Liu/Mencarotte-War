- Rotational spectroscopy is [concerned with the measurement of] [the energies of transitions between] [quantized rotational states of molecules]([[rotational state]]) in the [[gas phase]]. The spectra of [[polar molecule]]s [can be measured in absorption or emission] by [[microwave spectroscopy]][1] or by [[far infrared spectroscopy]]. The [rotational spectra] of [[non-polar molecule]]s [cannot be observed] [by those methods], but can be observed and measured by [[Raman spectroscopy]]. 
    - Rotational spectroscopy is [sometimes referred to as] [pure rotational spectroscopy] to distinguish it from [[rotational-vibrational spectroscopy]] where changes in [[rotational energy]] occur together with changes in [[vibrational energy]], and also from [ro-vibronic spectroscopy] (or just [[vibronic spectroscopy]]) where rotational, vibrational and [[electronic energy]] changes [occur simultaneously].

    - For rotational spectroscopy, molecules are [classified according to] [[symmetry]] into [spherical top], linear and [symmetric top]; [[analytical expression]]s [can be derived] for the [rotational energy terms] 转动能项 of these molecules. Analytical expressions can be derived for the fourth category, asymmetric top, for rotational levels up to J=3, but [higher energy levels] need to be determined using [[numerical method]]s. The rotational energies are [derived theoretically] by [considering the molecules to be] [rigid rotors](((DBztw3cgw))) and then [applying extra terms to] account for [[centrifugal distortion]], fine structure, hyperfine structure and Coriolis coupling. Fitting the spectra to the theoretical expressions gives numerical values of the angular moments of inertia from which very precise values of molecular bond lengths and angles can be derived in favorable cases. In the presence of an electrostatic field there is Stark splitting which allows molecular electric dipole moments to be determined.

    - [An important application of] rotational spectroscopy is in exploration of the [[chemical composition]] of the [[interstellar medium]] using [[radio telescope]]s.

- If more gently than Orpheus
who moved even the trees
you were to pluck the zither
the life-blood would not return
to the vain shadow . . .
Harsh fate,
but its burden becomes lighter
to bear, since everything
that attempts to turn back
is impossible. (I, 24) / 因为一切回头的尝试 都是徒劳
- [Past and future] are [different from each other]. [Cause precedes effect](((nvbzShJny))). Pain comes after a wound, not before it. The glass [shatters into a thousand pieces], and the pieces [do not re-form into a glass]. We cannot [change the past](((F7OVQ6hnu))); we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps. We can live toward it, shape it, because it [does not yet exist]. Everything is still possible. . . . Time is not a line [with two equal directions]: it is an arrow [with different extremities]. #[[time arrow]]

    - And it is this, rather than [the speed of its passing], that [matters most to us] about time. This is [the fundamental thing about] time. [The secret of time lies in] this slippage that we feel on our pulse, viscerally, in the enigma of memory, in anxiety about the future. 内心的脉搏滑动 This is what it means to think about time. What exactly is this flowing? Where is it nestled in [the grammar of the world]? What distinguishes the past, its having been, from the future, its not having been yet, in the folds of [the mechanism of the world]? Why, to us, is the past so different from the future?
    - [Nineteenth- and twentieth-century] physics [engaged with these questions] and [ran into something unexpected and disconcerting]—much more so than [the relatively marginal fact] that time passes at different speeds in different places. The difference between past and future, between [cause and effect](((axQMCf1xH))), between memory and hope, between regret and intention . . . [in the elementary laws] that [describe the mechanisms of the world], there is no such difference.
- ### HEAT
    - If I [watch a film] that [shows a ball rolling], [I cannot tell] if the film is [being projected correctly or in reverse]. But if [the ball stops], I know that [it is being run properly]; run backward, it would [show an implausible event]: a ball [starting to move by itself]. The ball’s slowing down and [coming to rest] are due to [[friction]], and [friction produces heat]. Only where there is heat is there a distinction between past and future. Thoughts, for instance, unfold from the past to the future, not vice versa—and, in fact, thinking produces heat in our heads. . . .
    - Clausius introduces a quantity that measures this irreversible progress of heat in only one direction and, since he was a cultivated German, he gives it a name taken from ancient Greek—entropy:
    - I prefer to take the names of important scientific quantities from ancient languages, so that they may be the same in all the living languages. I therefore propose to call entropy the quantity (S) of a body, from the Greek word for transformation: ἡ τροπὴ. 14
    - The page of the article by Clausius in which he introduces for the first time the concept and the word “entropy.” The equation provides the mathematical definition of the variation of entropy (S—S 0 ) of a body: the sum (integral) of the quantity of heat dQ leaving the body at the temperature T.

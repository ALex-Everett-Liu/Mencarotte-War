- If more gently than Orpheus
who moved even the trees
you were to pluck the zither
the life-blood would not return
to the vain shadow . . .
Harsh fate,
but its burden becomes lighter
to bear, since everything
that attempts to turn back
is impossible. (I, 24) / 因为一切回头的尝试 都是徒劳
- [Past and future] are [different from each other]. [Cause precedes effect](((nvbzShJny))). Pain comes after a wound, not before it. The glass [shatters into a thousand pieces], and the pieces [do not re-form into a glass]. We cannot [change the past](((F7OVQ6hnu))); we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps. We can live toward it, shape it, because it [does not yet exist]. Everything is still possible. . . . Time is not a line [with two equal directions]: it is an arrow [with different extremities]. #[[time arrow]]

- And it is this, rather than [the speed of its passing], that [matters most to us] about time. This is [the fundamental thing about] time. [The secret of time lies in] this slippage that we feel on our pulse, viscerally, in the enigma of memory, in anxiety about the future. 内心的脉搏滑动 This is what it means to think about time. What exactly is this flowing? Where is it nestled in the grammar of the world? What distinguishes the past, its having been, from the future, its not having been yet, in the folds of the mechanism of the world? Why, to us, is the past so different from the future?
- Nineteenth- and twentieth-century physics engaged with these questions and ran into something unexpected and disconcerting—much more so than the relatively marginal fact that time passes at different speeds in different places. The difference between past and future, between cause and effect, between memory and hope, between regret and intention . . . in the elementary laws that describe the mechanisms of the world, there is no such difference.

    - Albert.io offers the best [practice questions] for [high-stakes exams] 高风险考试 and [core courses] [spanning grades 6-12]. For over five years, [hundreds of thousands of students] have used Albert to [build confidence] and [score better] on their SAT®, ACT®, AP, and [Common Core tests]. If you're an educator interested in trying Albert, [click the button below] to learn about our [pilot program].
- Feedback is defined as [the information gained about] [a reaction to a product], which will allow the [[modification]] of the product. [[feedback loop]]s are therefore the process whereby [a change to the system] [results in an alarm] which will [trigger a certain result](((Ld6QAv8Tr))). This result will either [increase the change to the system] or reduce it to [bring the system back to normal]. A few questions remain: How do these systems work? What is a positive feedback? What is negative feedback? Where do we [find these systems in nature]?

- [Biological systems]([[biological system]]) [operate on a mechanism of inputs and outputs], each caused by and [causing a certain event]. A feedback loop is a [biological occurrence] wherein [the output of a system]([[system output]]) [amplifies the system] (positive feedback) or [inhibits the system] 抑制 (negative feedback). Feedback loops are important because they allow [[living organism]]s to **maintain homeostasis**. [Homeostasis](https://www.albert.io/blog/homeostasis-ap-biology-crash-course-review/) is the mechanism that [enables us to keep] our [[internal environment]] [relatively constant] – not too hot, or too cold, not too hungry or tired.

    - [The level of energy] that an organism needs to maintain [[homeostasis]] [depends on the type of organism], as well as [the environment it inhabits]. For example, a [cold-blooded fish] keeps its temperature at the same level as the water around it, and so doesn’t need to control its [[internal temperature]]. Compare this to a [warm-blooded whale] [in the same environment]: it needs to [keep its body temperature higher than] that of [the water around it], and so it will [expend more energy] in [[temperature regulation]].

    - [This is a difference between] **ectotherms **and **endotherms**: an [[ectotherm]] uses the [[environmental temperature]] to control its internal temperature (e.g. reptiles, amphibians, and fish), whereas an [[endotherm]] uses homeostasis to [maintain its internal temperature]. Endotherms can [maintain their metabolism]([[metabolism]]) [at a constant rate], allowing constant movement, reaction and [internal processes], whereas ectotherms cannot maintain their metabolism at a constant rate. This means that their movement, reaction and internal processes are [dependent on adequate external heat], but it also means that they [require less energy] [in the form of food], as their bodies are not [constantly burning fuel].

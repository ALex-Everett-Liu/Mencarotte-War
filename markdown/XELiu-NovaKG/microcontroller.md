- A microcontroller (MCU for [[microcontroller unit (MCU)]]) is a [[small computer]] on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) [[MOS integrated circuit]] (IC) chip. A microcontroller contains one or more [[CPU (central processing unit)]]s ([[processor core]]s) along with [[computer memory]] and programmable [[input/output peripheral device]]s. [[program memory]] in the form of [[ferroelectric RAM]], [NOR flash] or [OTP ROM] is also often included on chip, as well as [a small amount of RAM]. Microcontrollers are designed for [[embedded application]]s, in contrast to the [[microprocessor]]s used in [[personal computer (PC)]]s or other [general purpose applications] consisting of various [discrete chips]. #[[flash memory]]

    - In modern terminology, a microcontroller is similar to, but [less sophisticated than], a [[system on a chip (SoC)]]. An SoC may include a microcontroller [as one of its components], but usually integrates it with [advanced peripherals] like a [[graphics processing unit (GPU)]], a [[Wi-Fi module]], or one or more [[coprocessor]]s.

    - Microcontrollers are used in [automatically controlled products and devices](((pjNd_Tx3C))), such as [[automobile engine]] [[control system]]s, [[implantable medical device]]s, [[remote control]]s, office machines, 办公机器 [[appliance]]s, power tools, 电动工具 toys and other embedded systems. By [reducing the size and cost] compared to a design that [uses a separate microprocessor], memory, and [input/output devices](((AGdgghnHW))), microcontrollers [make it economical to] [digitally control] [even more devices and processes]. [[mixed signal microcontroller]]s are common, integrating [[analog component]]s needed to control [[non-digital electronic system]]s. In the context of the [[Internet of Things (IoT)]], microcontrollers are [an economical and popular means of] [[data collection]], [[sensing]] and [actuating the physical world](((RaaVIQp6o))) as [[edge device]]s.

    - Some microcontrollers may [use four-bit words] and [operate at frequencies] as low as 4 kHz for low [[power consumption]] (single-digit milliwatts or microwatts 毫瓦或微瓦). They [generally have the ability to] [retain functionality] while [waiting for an event](((kgjxbGoaS))) such as a [[button press]] or other [[interrupt]]; [power consumption while sleeping] ([[CPU clock]] and [most peripherals off]) may be just nanowatts, [making many of them well suited for] [[long lasting battery application]]s. Other microcontrollers may [serve performance-critical roles], where they [may need to act more like] a [[digital signal processor (DSP)]], with higher [[clock speed]]s and power consumption. www.[worlduc].com

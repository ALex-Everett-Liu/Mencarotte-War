- A microcontroller (MCU for [[microcontroller unit (MCU)]]) is a [[small computer]] on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) [[MOS integrated circuit]] (IC) chip. A microcontroller contains one or more [[CPU (central processing unit)]]s ([[processor core]]s) along with [[computer memory]] and programmable [[input/output peripheral device]]s. [[program memory]] in the form of [[ferroelectric RAM]], [NOR flash] or [OTP ROM] is also often included on chip, as well as [a small amount of RAM]. Microcontrollers are designed for [[embedded application]]s, in contrast to the [[microprocessor]]s used in [[personal computer (PC)]]s or other [general purpose applications] consisting of various [discrete chips]. #[[flash memory]]

    - In modern terminology, a microcontroller is similar to, but [less sophisticated than], a [[system on a chip (SoC)]]. An SoC may include a microcontroller [as one of its components], but usually integrates it with [advanced peripherals] like a [[graphics processing unit (GPU)]], a [[Wi-Fi module]], or one or more [[coprocessor]]s.

    - Microcontrollers are used in [automatically controlled products and devices](((pjNd_Tx3C))), such as [[automobile engine]] [[control system]]s, [[implantable medical device]]s, [[remote control]]s, office machines, 办公机器 [[appliance]]s, power tools, 电动工具 toys and other embedded systems. By [reducing the size and cost] compared to a design that [uses a separate microprocessor], memory, and [input/output devices](((AGdgghnHW))), microcontrollers [make it economical to] [digitally control] [even more devices and processes]. [[mixed signal microcontroller]]s are common, integrating [[analog component]]s needed to control [[non-digital electronic system]]s. In the context of the [[Internet of Things (IoT)]], microcontrollers are [an economical and popular means of] [[data collection]], [[sensing]] and [actuating the physical world](((RaaVIQp6o))) as [[edge device]]s.

    - Some microcontrollers may [use four-bit words] and [operate at frequencies] as low as 4 kHz for low [[power consumption]] (single-digit milliwatts or microwatts 毫瓦或微瓦). They [generally have the ability to] [retain functionality] while [waiting for an event](((kgjxbGoaS))) such as a [[button press]] or other [[interrupt]]; [power consumption while sleeping] ([[CPU clock]] and [most peripherals off]) may be just nanowatts, [making many of them well suited for] [[long lasting battery application]]s. Other microcontrollers may [serve performance-critical roles], where they [may need to act more like] a [[digital signal processor (DSP)]], with higher [[clock speed]]s and power consumption. www.[worlduc].com

    - The [[IC/die]] from an Intel 8742, an [8-bit microcontroller] that includes a CPU [running at 12 MHz], 128 bytes of RAM, 2048 bytes of EPROM, and I/O [in the same chip]
- ## Embedded design
    - A microcontroller [can be considered] a [[self-contained system]] with a processor, memory and [[peripheral]]s and [can be used as] an embedded system.[28] The majority of microcontrollers [in use today] are embedded in other [[machinery]], such as [[automobile]]s, [[telephone]]s, appliances, and peripherals for [[computer system]]s.

    - While some embedded systems are very sophisticated, many [have minimal requirements for] memory and [program length], with no operating system, and [low software complexity]. [Typical input and output devices] include [[switch]]es, [[relay]]s, [[solenoid]]s, [[LED]]'s, small or custom [[liquid-crystal display (LCD)]]s, 小型或定制 [[radio frequency device]]s, and [[sensor]]s [for data such as] temperature, humidity, [[light level]] etc. Embedded systems usually have no keyboard, screen, disks, printers, or other [recognizable I/O devices]([[I/O device]]) of a personal computer, and may lack [[human interaction device]]s of any kind.

    - Interrupts
        - Microcontrollers must provide [[real-time response]] to (predictable, though not necessarily fast) [events in the embedded system they are controlling]. When certain events occur, an [[interrupt system]] can [signal the processor to](((OV5j6k98r))) [suspend processing] 通知处理器[暂停处理] the [current instruction sequence](((SQmgy_TRf))) and to begin an [[interrupt service routine (ISR)]] (ISR, or "[[interrupt handler]]") which will [perform any processing required] [based on the source of the interrupt], [before returning to] the [original instruction sequence](((SQmgy_TRf))).

        - Possible [[interrupt source]]s are [device dependent](((MwkcUYphQ))), and [often include events such as] an [[internal timer overflow]], completing an [[analog to digital conversion]], a [[logic level change]] [on an input] such as [from a button being pressed](((pHLSU5UbS))), and [data received on](((YKC-z3rGs))) a [[communication link]]. Where [[power consumption]] is important as in [[battery device]]s, interrupts may also [wake a microcontroller from] a [[low-power sleep state]] [where the processor is halted](((TEXEBN31f))) [until required to do something] by a [[peripheral event]].

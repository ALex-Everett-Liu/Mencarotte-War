- [Simple problems] often follow a straightforward [[causal path]]. When a [[patient]] has a range of [[symptom]]s [strongly associated with] the [[flu]], the [[doctor]] might conclude from the [[observable variable]]s that there is one [[invisible variable]] - the [[influenza virus]]. [Treat]([[treat]]) [that](((cq-Muydqe))) [latent variable](((V48VqTgTu))), and the symptoms disappear.

- [Scott Alexander] observes that his [[peer]]s in [[psychiatry]] similarly try to [[attribute]] [a collection of linked symptoms] to a [[latent variable]]; for example, [[depression]].[6](((3TETGQHZF))) `{{alias:((1599))6}}` However, the symptoms ‘caused’ by depression - e.g. [[sleep disturbance]], [[fatigue]], [guilt](((6aEuFuH_I))) - can also have a [[causal effect]] on one another, and on the [[disorder]] itself.

    - This [[complex web]] of [[relationship]]s, which may include [[feedback loop]]s, [does not follow a path of] [[linear causality]]. For [[complicated problem]]s of this nature, [[nodal network]]s are a [much more accurate]([[accurate]]) [[model]]:

    - A model of [[major depression (MD)]] and [[generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)]] by Nuijten, Deserno, Cramer, and Borsboom.[7](((mVlvE90kK))) The disorders roughly map onto [clusters of symptoms](((p2IldDrA8))) that are [often found together] and [reinforce one another]([[reinforce]]), but [there is no clear ‘bright line’] [between the conditions].

- Even at [face value](((o_bE6RBcl))), a nodal network [provides a visual aid to] [[problem-solving]] - a [[bird’s eye view]] of [the connections between various elements]. [This may help to] [identify patterns or clusters] which may be [[counterintuitive]] or [entirely invisible]([[invisible]]) when [each piece of the puzzle]([[puzzle]]) is examined at the [[object level]]. 在对象层面上进行检验

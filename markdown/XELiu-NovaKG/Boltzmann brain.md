- The Boltzmann brain argument suggests that [it is more likely] for [a single brain] to [spontaneously and briefly form in a void]([[void]]) 在虚空中自发地和短暂地形成 (complete with a false memory of having existed in our universe) than it is for the universe to have come about 发生, 改变方向 [in the way modern science thinks it actually did]. [It was first proposed as] a [[reductio ad absurdum]] response to [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s [early explanation for] the [[low-entropy state]] of our universe.[1]

    - In this physics [[thought experiment]], a Boltzmann brain is [a fully formed brain], complete with [memories of a full human life] in our universe, that arises due to extremely rare [[random fluctuation]]s out of [a state of thermodynamic equilibrium]([[thermodynamic equilibrium state]]). Theoretically, over [an extremely large] but not [infinite amount of time], [by sheer chance] [atoms in a void] could [spontaneously come together] in such a way as to [assemble a functioning human brain]([[human brain]]). Like any brain [in such circumstances], it would [almost immediately stop functioning] and [begin to deteriorate](((SfhYzGbLA))).[2]

- The idea is named after the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906), who in 1896 published a theory that tried to account for the fact that humans find themselves in a universe that is not as chaotic as the budding field of thermodynamics seemed to predict. He offered several explanations, one of them being that the universe, even one that is fully random (or at thermal equilibrium), would spontaneously fluctuate to a more ordered (or low-entropy) state. One criticism of this "Boltzmann universe" hypothesis is that the most common thermal fluctuations are as close to equilibrium overall as possible; thus, by any reasonable criterion, actual humans in the actual universe would be vastly less likely than "Boltzmann brains" existing alone in an empty universe.[citation needed]
- Boltzmann brains gained new relevance around 2002, when some cosmologists started to become concerned that, in many existing theories about the Universe, human brains in the current universe appear to be vastly outnumbered by Boltzmann brains in the future Universe who, by chance, have exactly the same perceptions that people do; this leads to the conclusion that statistically humans are likely to be Boltzmann brains. Such a reductio ad absurdum argument is sometimes used to argue against certain theories of the Universe. When applied to more recent theories about the multiverse, Boltzmann brain arguments are part of the unsolved measure problem of cosmology. Boltzmann brains remain a thought experiment; physicists do not believe that humans are actually Boltzmann brains, but rather use the thought experiment as a tool for evaluating competing scientific theories.[citation needed]

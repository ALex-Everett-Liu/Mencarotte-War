- Abstract
    - The Boltzmann brain argument suggests that [it is more likely] for [a single brain] to [spontaneously and briefly form in a void]([[void]]) 在虚空中自发地和短暂地形成 (complete with a false memory of having existed in our universe) than it is for the universe to have come about 发生, 改变方向 [in the way modern science thinks it actually did]. [It was first proposed as] a [[reductio ad absurdum]] response to [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s [early explanation for] the [[low-entropy state]] of our universe.[1]

        - In this physics [[thought experiment]], a Boltzmann brain is [a fully formed brain], complete with [memories of a full human life] in our universe, that arises due to extremely rare [[random fluctuation]]s out of [a state of thermodynamic equilibrium]([[thermodynamic equilibrium state]]). Theoretically, over [an extremely large] but not [infinite amount of time], [by sheer chance] [atoms in a void] could [spontaneously come together] in such a way as to [assemble a functioning human brain]([[human brain]]). Like any brain [in such circumstances], it would [almost immediately stop functioning] and [begin to deteriorate](((SfhYzGbLA))).[2]

    - The idea is named after the [Austrian physicist] Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906), who in 1896 [published a theory] that [tried to account for the fact that] [humans find themselves in a universe that] is not [as chaotic as the budding field of] thermodynamics [seemed to predict]. He [offered several explanations], one of them being that the universe, even one that is [fully random] (or at [[thermal equilibrium]]), would [spontaneously fluctuate to] a more ordered (or low-entropy) state. [One criticism of](((OCKkzL5LI))) this ["Boltzmann universe" hypothesis] is that the most common [[thermal fluctuation]]s are [as close to equilibrium overall as possible]; thus, [by any reasonable criterion](((nRO8oGWTa))), actual humans [in the actual universe] [would be vastly less likely than] "Boltzmann brains" existing alone [in an empty universe](((vSt_uR2WT))).[citation needed]
(宇宙为何不像热力学所预示的那样混乱-热力学随机涨落通常只在极其接近于热力学平衡态附近的范围内进行，而不会自发涨落至更有序的低熵态-而热力学平衡态是一种混乱无序的自发状态)

        - [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boltzmann2.jpg), after whom Boltzmann brains are named
    - Boltzmann brains [gained new relevance](((F_o40wTHB))) around 2002, when some cosmologists [started to become concerned that], in many [existing theories] about the Universe, human brains [in the current universe] [appear to be vastly outnumbered by] [Boltzmann brains] [in the future Universe] who, by chance, [have exactly the same perceptions] that people do; this [leads to the conclusion that] statistically humans are [likely to be Boltzmann brains]. Such a [reductio ad absurdum argument] is sometimes [used to argue against certain theories] of the Universe. When [applied to more recent theories] about the [[multiverse]], [Boltzmann brain arguments] are part of the unsolved [measure problem of cosmology](((5_MXWsOaA))). Boltzmann brains [remain a thought experiment]; physicists [do not believe that] [humans are actually Boltzmann brains], but rather [use the thought experiment] [as a tool for] [evaluating competing scientific theories](((ovZkjJOV3))).[citation needed] #pt9-100

- Boltzmann universe
    - In 1896, the mathematician Ernst Zermelo advanced a theory that the second law of thermodynamics was absolute rather than statistical.[3] Zermelo bolstered his theory by pointing out that the Poincaré recurrence theorem shows statistical entropy in a closed system must eventually be a periodic function; therefore, the Second Law, which is always observed to increase entropy, is unlikely to be statistical. To counter Zermelo's argument, the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann advanced two theories. The first theory, now believed to be the correct one, is that the Universe started for some unknown reason in a low-entropy state. The second and alternative theory, published in 1896 but attributed in 1895 to Boltzmann's assistant Ignaz Schütz, is the "Boltzmann universe" scenario. In this scenario, the Universe spends the vast majority of eternity in a featureless state of heat death; however, over enough eons, eventually a very rare thermal fluctuation will occur where atoms bounce off each other in exactly such a way as to form a substructure equivalent to our entire observable universe. Boltzmann argues that, while most of the universe is featureless, humans do not see those regions because they are devoid of intelligent life; to Boltzmann, it is unremarkable that humanity views solely the interior of its Boltzmann universe, as that is the only place where intelligent life lives. (This may be the first use in modern science of the anthropic principle).[4][5]
    - In 1931, astronomer Arthur Eddington pointed out that, because a large fluctuation is exponentially less probable than a small fluctuation, observers in Boltzmann universes will be vastly outnumbered by observers in smaller fluctuations. Physicist Richard Feynman published a similar counterargument within his widely-read 1964 Feynman Lectures on Physics. By 2004, physicists had pushed Eddington's observation to its logical conclusion: the most numerous observers in an eternity of thermal fluctuations would be minimal "Boltzmann brains" popping up in an otherwise featureless universe.[4][6]

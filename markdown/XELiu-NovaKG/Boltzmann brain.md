- Abstract
    - The Boltzmann brain argument suggests that [it is more likely] for [a single brain] to [spontaneously and briefly form in a void]([[void]]) 在虚空中自发地和短暂地形成 (complete with a false memory of having existed in our universe) than it is for the universe to have come about 发生, 改变方向 [in the way modern science thinks it actually did]. [It was first proposed as] a [[reductio ad absurdum]] response to [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s [early explanation for] the [[low-entropy state]] of our universe.[1]

        - In this physics [[thought experiment]], a Boltzmann brain is [a fully formed brain], complete with [memories of a full human life] in our universe, that arises due to extremely rare [[random fluctuation]]s out of [a state of thermodynamic equilibrium]([[thermodynamic equilibrium state]]). Theoretically, over [an extremely large] but not [infinite amount of time], [by sheer chance] [atoms in a void] could [spontaneously come together] in such a way as to [assemble a functioning human brain]([[human brain]]). Like any brain [in such circumstances], it would [almost immediately stop functioning] and [begin to deteriorate](((SfhYzGbLA))).[2]

    - The idea is named after the [Austrian physicist] Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906), who in 1896 [published a theory] that [tried to account for the fact that] [humans find themselves in a universe that] is not [as chaotic as the budding field of] thermodynamics [seemed to predict]. He [offered several explanations], one of them being that the universe, even one that is [fully random] (or at [[thermal equilibrium]]), would [spontaneously fluctuate to] a more ordered (or low-entropy) state. [One criticism of](((OCKkzL5LI))) this ["Boltzmann universe" hypothesis] is that the most common [[thermal fluctuation]]s are [as close to equilibrium overall as possible]; thus, [by any reasonable criterion](((nRO8oGWTa))), actual humans [in the actual universe] [would be vastly less likely than] "Boltzmann brains" existing alone [in an empty universe](((vSt_uR2WT))).[citation needed]

        - [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boltzmann2.jpg), after whom Boltzmann brains are named
    - Boltzmann brains [gained new relevance](((F_o40wTHB))) around 2002, when some cosmologists [started to become concerned that], in many [existing theories] about the Universe, human brains [in the current universe] [appear to be vastly outnumbered by] [Boltzmann brains] [in the future Universe] who, by chance, [have exactly the same perceptions] that people do; this [leads to the conclusion that] statistically humans are [likely to be Boltzmann brains]. Such a [reductio ad absurdum argument] is sometimes [used to argue against certain theories] of the Universe. When [applied to more recent theories] about the [[multiverse]], [Boltzmann brain arguments] are part of the unsolved [measure problem of cosmology](((5_MXWsOaA))). Boltzmann brains [remain a thought experiment]; physicists [do not believe that] [humans are actually Boltzmann brains], but rather [use the thought experiment] [as a tool for] [evaluating competing scientific theories](((ovZkjJOV3))).[citation needed] #pt9-100

- Boltzmann universe
    - In 1896, the mathematician [[Ernst Zermelo]] [advanced a theory that] [[the second law of thermodynamics]] was [absolute rather than statistical].[3] Zermelo [bolstered his theory by pointing out that] 支撑 the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]] shows [[statistical entropy]] in a [[closed system]] [must eventually be] a [[periodic function]]; therefore, the Second Law, which is [always observed to] [increase entropy](((6jUysxvZP))), is unlikely to be statistical. To counter Zermelo's argument, the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann [advanced two theories](((1rpdXnb1W))). The first theory, now believed to be the correct one, is that the Universe started [for some unknown reason] in a low-entropy state. 
        - The second and [alternative theory](((jGGa4Lb5x))), published in 1896 but attributed in 1895 to [Boltzmann's assistant] [[Ignaz Schütz]], 归属于 is the "Boltzmann universe" scenario. In this scenario, the Universe [spends the vast majority of eternity](((d2kD9jgfb))) [in a featureless state of heat death]([[heat death]]); 平凡的状态 however, [over enough eons](((VqEKxTHt0))), eventually [a very rare thermal fluctuation] will occur where [atoms bounce off each other] 相互弹动 [in exactly such a way as to] [form a substructure](((bqdfO1hTG))) equivalent to our entire [[observable universe]]. Boltzmann argues that, while [most of the universe] is featureless, humans [do not see those regions] because they are [devoid of intelligent life](((zQE7T-xwM))); 完全没有, 缺乏 to Boltzmann, [it is unremarkable that] humanity views solely [the interior of its Boltzmann universe]([[Boltzmann universe]]), as [that is the only place where] [intelligent life lives]. ([This may be the first use in] [[modern science]] of the [[anthropic principle]]).[4][5]

        - In 1931, astronomer [[Arthur Eddington]] pointed out that, because [a large fluctuation] is [exponentially less probable than] [a small fluctuation], observers in Boltzmann universes [will be vastly outnumbered by] [observers in smaller fluctuations](((JgjwOCstW))). Physicist Richard Feynman [published a similar counterargument] within his widely-read 1964 [[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]. By 2004, physicists had [pushed Eddington's observation to] its [[logical conclusion]]: [the most numerous observers] in [an eternity of thermal fluctuations] would be minimal "Boltzmann brains" popping up [in an otherwise featureless universe].[4][6]

- [Spontaneous formation]([[spontaneous formation]])
    - In the universe's [eventual state] of [ergodic "heat death"](((KUkqTYl27))), given enough time, every [possible structure] (including every possible brain) [gets formed via random fluctuation]. The [[timescale]] for this is related to the [Poincaré recurrence time].[4][7][8] [Boltzmann-style thought experiments] focus on structures like [human brains] that are presumably [self-aware observers](((YDO32vD7S))). [Given any arbitrary criteria for]([[arbitrary criteria]]) [what constitutes a Boltzmann brain] (or planet, or universe), [smaller structures] that [minimally and barely meet the criteria] are vastly and [exponentially more common than] larger structures; [a rough analogy] is [how the odds of] [a real English word] showing up when one [shakes a box of Scrabble letters] 拼字游戏字母盒 are [greater than the odds that] [a whole English sentence] or paragraph will form.[9] The [average timescale] required for [the formation of a Boltzmann brain] is [vastly greater than] [the current age of the Universe]. In modern physics, Boltzmann brains [can be formed either by] [[quantum fluctuation]], or by a [[thermal fluctuation]] generally involving [[nucleation]].[4] 
(宇宙的最终状态是一个各态历经的热寂状态，所以，只要给定足够长的时间，任何可能形成的结构最终都会从随机涨落中得以发生-相比于人类大脑以及更大更复杂的结构，任何更小更简单的等价于玻尔兹曼大脑的结构则是概率更大的现实)

    - Via quantum fluctuation
        - By one calculation, a Boltzmann brain [would appear as] [a quantum fluctuation in the vacuum] [after a time interval of] $$\displaystyle 10^{10^{50}}$$ years. This fluctuation can occur even in a true [[Minkowski vacuum]] (a [flat spacetime vacuum] lacking [[vacuum energy]]). Quantum mechanics [heavily favors smaller fluctuations] that ["borrow" the least amount of energy from the vacuum]. Typically, a [quantum Boltzmann brain] would [suddenly appear from] the vacuum (alongside [an equivalent amount of] [[virtual antimatter]]), [remain only long enough to] [have a single coherent thought or observation], 连贯的思维过程 and then [disappear into the vacuum] [as suddenly as it appeared]. ^^Such a brain is^^ [completely self-contained]([[self-contained]]), and can never [radiate energy out to infinity](((NDQ59nkIH))).[10] 把能量辐射到无穷远

    - Via nucleation
        - [Current evidence suggests that] [the vacuum permeating the observable Universe] is not a [[Minkowski space]], but rather a [[de Sitter space]] [with a positive cosmological constant]([[cosmological constant]]).[11]:30 In a de Sitter vacuum (but not in a Minkowski vacuum), a Boltzmann brain can form via nucleation of [[non-virtual particle]]s [gradually assembled by chance] from the [[Hawking radiation]] emitted from the de Sitter space's [bounded](((HvKzzDBrC))) [[cosmological horizon]]. 有界宇宙学视界 One estimate for [the average time required until nucleation] is around $$\displaystyle 10^{10^{69}}$$ years.[10] A typical nucleated Boltzmann brain will, after it finishes its activity, cool off to absolute zero and eventually completely decay, as any isolated object would in the vacuum of space. Unlike the quantum fluctuation case, the Boltzmann brain will radiate energy out to infinity. In nucleation, the most common fluctuations are as close to thermal equilibrium overall as possible given whatever arbitrary criteria are provided for labeling a fluctuation a "Boltzmann brain".[4]

        - Theoretically a Boltzmann brain can also form, albeit again with a tiny probability, at any time during the matter-dominated early universe.[12]

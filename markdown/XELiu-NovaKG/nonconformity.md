- [[non conformance]]
- ---
- In quality management, a nonconformity (sometimes referred to as a [[defect]]) is a deviation from a [[specification]], a [[standard]], or an expectation. Nonconformities [can be classified in seriousness]([[seriousness]]) multiple ways, though [a typical classification scheme] [may have three to four levels], including critical, serious, major, and minor.[1][2][3][4]

    - [While some situations allow] "nonconformity" and "defect" to be [used synonymously], some industries [distinguish between the two]; a nonconformity represents [a failure to meet an intended state] and specification, while a defect represents a failure to [meet fitness for use]/[normal usage requirements].[2] 适用性 This can be seen in the [international software engineering standard] [ISO/IEC 25010] (formerly ISO/IEC 9126), which [defines a nonconformity as] [the nonfulfillment of a requirement] and a defect as the nonfulfillment of intended [[usage requirement]]s.[5]

    - Quantum mechanics is a [[fundamental theory]] in physics that [provides a description of] the [[physical properties]] of nature [at the scale of] atoms and [[subatomic particle]]s.[2]:[1.1](((SCwkcngus))) It is the foundation of all [[quantum physics]] including [[quantum chemistry]], [[quantum field theory]], [[quantum technology]], and [[quantum information science]].

    - [Classical physics]([[classical physics]]), [the description of physics] that existed before the [[theory of relativity]] and quantum mechanics, [describes many aspects of nature] at an [[ordinary scale]] ([[macroscopic scale]]), while quantum mechanics [explains the aspects of nature] at [[small scale]] (atomic and subatomic scales), for which [[classical mechanics]] is [[insufficient]]. Most theories in classical physics [can be derived from] quantum mechanics as an [[approximation]] [[valid]] at [[large scale]] (macroscopic) scale.[3](((j56W60Fld)))
        Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, [[angular momentum]], and other quantities of a [[bound system]] are restricted to [[discrete value]]s ([[quantization]]), [[object]]s have [[characteristics]] of both particles and waves ([wave-particle duality]), and there are [[limit]]s to [how accurately the value of] a [[physical quantity]] can be predicted [[prior to its measurement]], given a [[complete set]] of [[initial condition]]s (the [[uncertainty principle]]). #[[discrete mathematics]]

    - Quantum mechanics [arose gradually] from theories to [explain observations] which [could not be reconciled with] classical physics, such as Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the [[black-body radiation]] problem, and the [[correspondence]] between [[energy]] and [[frequency]] in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper which explained the [[photoelectric effect]]. These [early attempts] to understand [[microscopic phenomena]], now known as the "[[old quantum theory]]", led to the [full development] of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and others.

        - Early [[quantum theory]] was [profoundly re-conceived] [in the mid-1920s] by [Niels Bohr], Erwin Schrödinger, [Werner Heisenberg], [Max Born] [and others]. The original interpretation of quantum mechanics is the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], developed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in Copenhagen [during the 1920s]. 
This paragraph had been revised after November, 2020...
        - The [[modern theory]] is formulated in [various]([[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]]) [specially developed] [[mathematical formalism]]s. In one of them, a [[mathematical entity]] called the [[wave function]] [provides information], in the form of [[probability amplitude]]s, about what measurements of a particle's energy, momentum, and other [physical properties] may [[yield]].
    - [Wavefunctions]([[wavefunction]]) of the electron in a [[hydrogen atom]] at different [[energy level]]s. [Quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hydrogen_Density_Plots.png) [cannot predict] the [[exact location]] of [a particle in space], only [the probability of finding it]([[finding probability]]) [at different locations].[1](((Ih2YblStG))) The [[brighter area]]s represent [a higher probability] of [[finding the electron]].

- ## Overview and [fundamental concepts]
    - Quantum mechanics allows [the calculation of probabilities] for how [[physical system]]s can behave. It is [typically applied to] [[microscopic system]]s: molecules, atoms and [[sub-atomic particle]]s. Predictions of quantum mechanics have been [[verified experimentally]] to [an extremely high degree] of [[accuracy]].[note 1] 
    - A basic [[mathematical feature]] of quantum mechanics is that a probability is found by [taking the square of] the [[absolute value]] of a [[complex number]], known as a [[probability amplitude]]. This is known as the [[Born rule]], named after physicist [[Max Born]]. For example, a [quantum particle] like an electron [can be described by] a wave function, which associates to [each point in space]([[space point]]) a probability amplitude. [Applying the Born rule to] these amplitudes gives a [[probability density function]] for the position that [the electron will be found]([[finding the electron]]) to have [when an experiment is performed]([[perform an experiment]]) to measure it. The [[Schrödinger equation]] [relates the collection of] probability amplitudes that [pertain to one moment of time] to the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to another.
        - One consequence of the [[mathematical rule]]s of quantum mechanics is a tradeoff in [[predictability]] [between different measurable quantities]. [The most famous form] of this [[uncertainty principle]] says that no matter how a [[quantum particle]] is [prepared]([[prepare the particle]]) or how carefully [experiments upon it are arranged] (arrange the experiment carefully), [it is impossible to] [have a precise prediction for] a measurement of its position and also for [a measurement of its momentum].
        - Another consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is the phenomenon of [[quantum interference]], which is often illustrated with the [[double-slit experiment]]. In the [basic version] of this experiment, a [[coherent light source]], such as a [[laser beam]], [illuminates a plate]([[illuminate the plate]]) pierced by two [[parallel slit]]s, and the light [passing through the slits] is [observed on a screen] [behind the plate].[4]:102–111[2]:1.1–1.8 [The wave nature of light]([[the wave nature of light]]) causes the [[light wave]]s [passing through the two slits] to interfere, producing [[bright and dark bands]] [on the screen] – a result that [would not be expected] if light consisted of [[classical particle]]s.[4] 
210308-11:28
            - However, the light is always found to be [absorbed at the screen] at [[discrete point]]s, as [[individual particle]]s rather than waves; the [[interference pattern]] appears via the [[varying density]] of these particle [hits on the screen]. Furthermore, [versions of the experiment] that include [detectors at the slits]([[detector]]) find that each [[detected photon]] [passes through one slit] (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave).[4]:109[5][6] However, [such experiments demonstrate that] particles do not [form the interference pattern] if one detects [which slit they pass through]. Other [atomic-scale entities]([[atomic-scale entity]]), such as electrons, are found to [exhibit the same behavior] when [fired towards a double slit].[2] This behavior is known as [[wave-particle duality]].
    - When [[quantum system]]s interact, [the result can be] [the creation of] [[quantum entanglement]]: their properties [become so intertwined] that [a description of the whole]([[whole description]]) solely in terms of the [[individual part]]s is [no longer possible]. [[Erwin Schrödinger]] called entanglement "...the [characteristic trait] of quantum mechanics, the one that [enforces its entire departure from] [classical lines of thought]".[9] 
        - Quantum entanglement enables the [counter-intuitive properties]([[counter-intuitive property]]) of [[quantum pseudo-telepathy]], and can be [a valuable resource] in [[communication protocol]]s, such as [[quantum key distribution]] and [[superdense coding]].[10] Contrary to [popular misconception], entanglement does not allow [[sending signals]] [[faster than light (FTL)]], [as demonstrated by] the [[no-communication theorem]].[10]
        - [Another possibility opened by] entanglement is testing for "[[hidden variable]]s", [hypothetical properties] [more fundamental than] the quantities addressed in quantum theory itself, knowledge of which would [allow more exact predictions] than [quantum theory can provide]. A collection of results, [most significantly] [[Bell's theorem]], have demonstrated that [broad classes of] such [hidden-variable theories] are [in fact incompatible with] [quantum physics]. According to Bell's theorem, if nature actually [operates in accord with] any theory of [local hidden variables], then the results of a [[Bell test]] [will be constrained] in a particular, quantifiable way. Many Bell tests [have been performed], using [[entangled particles]], and [they have shown results] incompatible with [the constraints imposed by] [local hidden variables].[11][12]
    - [It is not possible to] [present these concepts] in [more than a superficial way] without introducing [the actual mathematics involved]; [understanding quantum mechanics] [requires not only] [manipulating complex numbers], but also [[linear algebra]], [[differential equation]]s, [[group theory]], and other [more advanced subjects].[note 2] Accordingly, [this article will present] [a mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics] and [survey its application to] some useful and [oft-studied examples]. 综述其应用 经常研究的例子

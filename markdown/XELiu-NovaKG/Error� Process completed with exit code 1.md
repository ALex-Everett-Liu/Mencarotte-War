- I [set up my repo] for [roam backup] [under the instructions] [from](https://eriknewhard.com/blog/backup-roam-in-github): erik blog, and I have [finished those steps].
    - > To [check the progress] of the first run, go back to Actions.
    - > Under All Workflows, click the [3 dots] on the first result, then click View workflow file.
    - > (If there are no results, try [refreshing the page] [after several seconds].)
    - > Under Roam Research backup, click Backup.
    - It seems that the backup doesn't work, this is the error:

- I have 13 [failed runs] [in a row] with a new [error code] I [haven't seen before]. I suspect a Roam update [broke something]. #[[file not found]]
    - `FileNotFoundError: [Errno Impossible to download {} in {}] markdown: PosixPath('/tmp/tmpjpzqii4i')`

    - [@MatthieuBizien](https://github.com/MatthieuBizien) doesn't seem to [be on here often], and the [random run failures] [have been increasing over the past few weeks], and now every hour. I don't know Python, so I've [started coding] own automatic backup solution- [a light version] using node and puppeteer (which will ignore markdown and [pretty formatting], and just download the [JSON exports])

- Reworked [@everruler12](https://github.com/everruler12)'s repo a bit by [adding comments] and [created an easy template to copy]([[template]]) so that you can [start backing up right away].
    - > I'm planning to add [[rolling backups]] and then [fixing EDN] and Markdown this week. 回滚备份
    - [[RoamResearch-Backup-to-GIT-Template]]
- For what it's worth, the [python-based backup] in this repo [appears to be working again].
    - If you keep using `roam-to-git` I [highly recommend] people use [@adithyabsk](https://github.com/adithyabsk) 's [[fork]] as it supports [[formatted edn]] and is [pretty decently fast] 相当快 on my [large graph] with `jet`. [Formatted edn](https://github.com/adithyabsk/roam-to-git) is [the only way to] make
        - [[diffable]]
        - [[full fidelity backups]] 完全保真度
    - [[JSON]] and [[markdown]] based backups are [fundamentally broken].

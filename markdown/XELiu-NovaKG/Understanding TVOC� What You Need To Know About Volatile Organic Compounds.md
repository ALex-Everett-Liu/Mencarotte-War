- [Indoor air quality]([[indoor air quality]]) is [one of the most integral components] 必要的组成部分 of [[wellness]]. Since we [spend the majority of our time] indoors, [we need to be sure that] we are [breathing healthy air] [in our home], [[workplace]], and school. [Now more than ever](https://learn.kaiterra.com/en/air-academy/indoor-air-quality-coronavirus-outbreak), [clean air] is essential.
    - Despite their significance, [many facets of] indoor air quality [don’t receive the attention they deserve], and some [[indoor air pollutant]]s [can seem quite inscrutable]. 不可测知 One group of [[air pollutant]]s [we receive many questions about] are VOCs, or [[volatile organic compounds (VOCs)]]. The [sheer diversity within this group] of [indoor pollutants] [can be daunting], [so we decided to] tackle these tricky pollutants [in this article].

- ## What Are VOCs?
    - [Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-are-volatile-organic-compounds-vocs) are a group of compounds with high vapor pressure and low water solubility. In other words, these substances won’t easily [bind to themselves](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/vapour-pressure) (volatile) or [dissolve in water](https://www.chem.fsu.edu/chemlab/chm1046course/solnprocess.html) (organic). Inside your home, volatile organic compounds are harmful, carcinogenic air pollutants that evaporate at normal indoor atmospheric conditions.
    - Much like [particulate matter](https://learn.kaiterra.com/en/air-academy/particulate-matter-pm), the term “VOC” doesn’t refer to a specific substance; instead, it refers to a group of substances that exhibit similar chemical properties. There are thousands of these substances, with [some examples](https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/air/toxins/voc.htm) including:
    - When [measuring the amount of] VOCs in your home, [you will often come across the term] [TVOC, or total volatile organic compounds](https://learn.kaiterra.com/en/air-academy/total-volatile-organic-compounds). Just what does [[total volatile organic compounds (TVOC)]] stand for?
    - ### Why TVOC is difficult to define
        - Because there are so many VOCs, [it’s impossible to] [monitor all of them continuously]. Thus, a measurement known as TVOC was adopted to [measure the overall amount of] VOCs [in a given space].
            - **Total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) is a group of VOCs used to [represent the entire pool of pollutants].** If you have an [air quality monitor with volatile organic compound detection capabilities](https://www.kaiterra.com/en/laser-egg-chemical/), you will see your [[reading]]s in terms of TVOC.
        - Unfortunately, TVOC isn’t [uniformly defined]. Many standards [include different VOCs] in their [TVOC grouping], or [assign different weights]([[assigned weightings]]) [when calculating TVOC]. This can make the definition of TVOC [difficult to parse], [as we can’t say definitively] [what VOCs are in TVOC].

(定义一个TVOC组，确定包含多少种VOCs成分及各自的比重)
            - For example, one scientist may [use a grouping of 20 VOCs to define TVOC], while another may draw from 30 different VOCs. Because there isn’t a [standardized interpretation] of TVOC, there are many [TVOC definitions] in use.

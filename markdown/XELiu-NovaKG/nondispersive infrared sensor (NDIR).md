- A nondispersive infrared sensor (or NDIR sensor) is a simple [[spectroscopic sensor]] often used as a [[gas detector]]. It is non-dispersive [in the fact that] no [[dispersive element]] (e.g a [[prism]] or [[diffraction grating]] [as is often present in other spectrometers]) is used to separate out (like a [[monochromator]]) the [broadband light] into a [narrow spectrum] [suitable for gas sensing]([[gas sensing]]). [The majority of NDIR sensors] use a [broadband lamp source] and an [[optical filter]] to [select a narrow band spectral region](((yPhhp_s3S))) that [overlaps with the absorption region] of [the gas of interest]. [In this context] narrow may be 50-300nm [[bandwidth]]. Modern NDIR sensors may use [[microelectromechanical systems (MEMs)]] or [mid IR LED sources], with or without an optical filter.

- ## Principle
    - The [main components] of an NDIR sensor are an [infrared (IR) source (lamp)], a [[sample chamber]] or [[light tube]], a [light filter](((wtRuwV5GZ))) and an [[infrared detector]]. The [IR light] is [directed through the sample chamber towards the detector]. [In parallel there is another chamber] with an [enclosed reference gas]([[reference gas]]), typically [[nitrogen]]. [The gas in the sample chamber] causes [absorption of specific wavelengths] according to the [[Beer–Lambert law]], and the [[attenuation]] of these wavelengths is [measured by the detector] to determine the [[gas concentration]]. [The detector has an optical filter in front of it] that [eliminates all light except] the wavelength that the [selected gas molecules] can absorb.

    - Ideally [other gas molecules] [do not absorb light at this wavelength], and do not [affect the amount of light] [reaching the detector] however [some cross-sensitivity is inevitable]([[cross-sensitivity]]).[1] For instance, [many measurements in the IR area] are [[cross sensitive]] to H2O so gases like CO2, SO2 and NO2 often [initiate cross sensitivity in] [low concentrations].[citation needed][2]

- A nondispersive infrared sensor (or NDIR sensor) is a simple [[spectroscopic sensor]] often used as a [[gas detector]]. It is non-dispersive [in the fact that] no [[dispersive element]] (e.g a [[prism]] or [[diffraction grating]] [as is often present in other spectrometers]) is used to separate out (like a [[monochromator]]) the [broadband light] into a [narrow spectrum] [suitable for gas sensing]([[gas sensing]]). [The majority of NDIR sensors] use a [broadband lamp source](((DGS_qpGAz))) and an [[optical filter]] to [select a narrow band spectral region](((yPhhp_s3S))) that [overlaps with the absorption region] of [the gas of interest]. [In this context] narrow may be 50-300nm [[bandwidth]]. Modern NDIR sensors may use [[microelectromechanical systems (MEMs)]] or [mid IR LED sources](((LdpOLEgP1))), with or without an optical filter.

- ## Principle
    - The [main components] of an NDIR sensor are an [infrared (IR) source (lamp)], a [[sample chamber]] or [[light tube]], a [light filter](((wtRuwV5GZ))) and an [[infrared detector]]. The [IR light] is [directed through the sample chamber towards the detector]. [In parallel there is another chamber] with an [enclosed reference gas]([[reference gas]]), typically [[nitrogen]]. [The gas in the sample chamber] causes [absorption of specific wavelengths] according to the [[Beer–Lambert law]], and the [[attenuation]] of these wavelengths is [measured by the detector] to determine the [[gas concentration]]. [The detector has an optical filter in front of it] that [eliminates all light except] the wavelength that the [selected gas molecules] can absorb.

    - Ideally [other gas molecules] [do not absorb light at this wavelength], and do not [affect the amount of light] [reaching the detector] however [some cross-sensitivity is inevitable]([[cross-sensitivity]]).[1] For instance, [many measurements in the IR area] are [[cross sensitive]] to H2O so gases like CO2, SO2 and NO2 often [initiate cross sensitivity in] [low concentrations].[citation needed][2]
- Gases and their [sensing wavelengths]
    - Gases do not have a [specific sensing wavelength], rather there are regions of the [IR spectrum] where there are typically many thousands of [closely spaced] [[absorption line]]s. See the [Hitran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITRAN) database [for more information].

- 光源发出的[连续光谱][全部都投射到][被测样品]上，[待测组分]吸收其[特征吸收波带]的红外光。
- ? 由于[待测组分]的吸收[不仅限于某一波长]，而是一个吸收峰，在连续光谱范围 内，待测组分又[往往不止一个吸收峰]，因而就 NDIR 的[检测方式]来说[具有积分性质]。因此[不分光型仪器]的[灵敏度]比[分光型][高得多]，并且具有[较高的信噪比] 和[良好的稳定性]。

    - NDIR is an [[acronym]] for Non Dispersive Infra-Red. This means that when [a beam of infrared light] is [emitted from a light source] it does not “disperse” or [become scattered by substances] [between the light source and a detector].
        - [view our blog for more articles on the science of CO2](https://web.archive.org/web/20190307133039/http://www.edaphic.com.au/blog/)
    - A NDIR gas sensor specifically measures the abundance, or concentration, of gases in a [[sample chamber]]. If there are gases in the path from an infrared light source to a detector then, in a non-dispersive system, the light is absorbed by the gases. How much light is absorbed is a function of how much gas is between the light source and light detector.
    - Figure 1 is a schematic of a simple NDIR gas sensor designed to detect the gas carbon dioxide (CO2). The infrared light source is installed at one end of an enclosure and the light detector is installed at the opposite end. The light detector has a filter so it specifically only detects light in the electromagnetic spectrum that is related to CO2. An inlet and outlet between the light source and detector allows CO2 to freely move in and out of the enclosure.

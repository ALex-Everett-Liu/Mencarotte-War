- A diaphragm pump (also known as a [Membrane pump]) is a [[positive displacement pump]] that [uses a combination of] the [[reciprocating action]] of a [[rubber]], [[thermoplastic]] or [teflon diaphragm] 聚四氟乙烯隔膜 and suitable [[valve]]s [on either side of the diaphragm] (check valve, butterfly valves, flap valves, 蝶阀、翻板阀 or any other form of [[shut-off valve]]s) to [pump a fluid](((VyBEEyN4O))).

    - There are [three main types of] diaphragm pumps:
        - Those in which the diaphragm is [sealed with one side]([[seal]]) [in the fluid to be pumped], 待泵出的流体密封一侧 and the other in air or [[hydraulic fluid]]. The diaphragm is flexed, causing the [[volume]] of the [[pump chamber]] to [increase and decrease]. A pair of [non-return check valves]([[check valve]]) prevent [[reverse flow]] of the fluid.[1] 
210812-15:37
        - Those employing [volumetric positive displacement] 容积正位移 where the [[prime mover]] of the diaphragm is [[electro-mechanical]], working through a [[crank]] or [geared motor drive](((3-VCW2APV))), or purely [[mechanical]], such as with a [[lever]] or [[handle]]. This method flexes the diaphragm through simple mechanical action, and one side of the diaphragm is open to air.[2]

        - Those employing one or more unsealed diaphragms with the fluid to be pumped on both sides. The diaphragm(s) again are flexed, causing the volume to change.

- None of the books in my father's [dusty old bookcase] were forbidden. Yet while I was growing up, I never saw anyone [take one down]. Most were [massive tomes] —a comprehensive history of civilization, matching volumes of the great works of [[western literature]], numerous others I can no longer recall —that seemed [almost fused to shelves] that [bowed slightly] 微微弯曲 from decades of [steadfast support]. But way up on the highest shelf was [a thin little text] that, every now and then, would [catch my eye] because it [seemed so out of place], like Gulliver among the Brobdingnagians. In hindsight, [I'm not quite sure] why I [waited so long] before [taking a look]. Perhaps, as the years went by, the books seemed less like [material you read] and more like [family heirlooms] 传家宝 you [admire from afar]. Ultimately, such reverence [gave way to teenage brashness]. 让位于青少年的鲁莽 I reached up for the little text, dusted it off, and opened to page one. The first few lines were, to say the least, startling.
    - My [chance encounter] with Camus' book must have occurred during [an especially impressionable phase] because, more than anything else I'd read, his words [stayed with me]. [Time and again] I'd imagine how various people I'd met, or heard about, or [had seen on television] would [answer this primary of all questions]. [In retrospect](((Cn32jfs_v))), though, it was his second assertion—regarding the role of [[scientific progress]] —that, for me, proved particularly challenging. Camus acknowledged value in understanding [the structure of the universe], but as far as I could tell, he [rejected the possibility that] such understanding could [make any difference to] our [assessment of life's worth]. Now, certainly, my [teenage reading] of [[existential philosophy]] was about as sophisticated as Bart Simpson's reading of [[Romantic poetry]], but even so, Camus' conclusion [struck me as off the mark]. 给我留下了深刻的印象 To this [aspiring physicist](((LFy6ZI08I))), it seemed that [an informed appraisal of life] 知情评估 absolutely [required a full understanding of] [life's arena] —the universe. 
        - [I remember thinking that] if our species dwelled in [cavernous outcroppings] 出露地表, 矿苗 [buried deep underground] and so had yet to [discover the earth's surface], brilliant sunlight, an ocean breeze, and the stars that lie beyond, or if evolution had [proceeded along a different pathway] and we had yet to acquire any but [the sense of touch], so [everything we knew] came only from our [tactile impressions](((aTSLqYAWP))) of our [immediate environment], or if human mental faculties [stopped developing during early childhood] so our [emotional and analytical skills] [never progressed beyond] those of a five-year-old —in short, ^^如果我们的一切经历都只能是对真正实在的微不足道的描绘 if our experiences painted but [a paltry portrait of reality]—[our appraisal of life] [would be thoroughly compromised].^^ When we finally [found our way to] [earth's surface], or when we finally [gained the ability to] see, hear, smell, and taste, or when our minds were finally freed to develop [as they ordinarily do], our [[collective view]] of life and the cosmos would, of necessity, change radically. Our previously [compromised grasp of reality] would have [shed a very different light on] that [most fundamental of] all [philosophical questions].
        - But, you might ask, what of it? Surely, any [[sober assessment]] would conclude that although we might not [understand everything about the universe] — every aspect of [how matter behaves] or [life functions] —we are privy to the defining, broad-brush strokes gracing nature's canvas. Surely, as Camus intimated, progress in physics, such as understanding the number of [[space dimension]]s; or progress in [[neuropsychology]], such as understanding all the [[organizational structure]]s in the brain; or, for that matter, progress in any number of other [scientific undertakings] may [fill in important details], but their impact on our [evaluation of life] and reality would be minimal. Surely, reality is what we think it is; reality is [revealed to us by our experiences].
        - To one extent or another, this [view of reality] is one many of us hold, if only implicitly. I certainly find myself [thinking this way] [in day-to-day life](((dvEfFbdJ-))); [it's easy to be seduced by](((3226JMA4z))) the face nature reveals directly to our senses. Yet, in the decades [since first encountering] Camus' text, I've learned that [modern science] [tells a very different story]. The [overarching lesson] that has emerged from [[scientific inquiry]] [over the last century] is that [[human experience]] is often [a misleading guide to] [the true nature of reality](((FoL7j4EP7))). Lying just beneath [the surface of the everyday] is [a world we'd hardly recognize]. Followers of the [[occult]], devotees of [[astrology]], 虔诚的宗教信徒 and those who hold to [religious principles] that speak to [a reality beyond experience] have, from widely varying perspectives, long since arrived at a similar conclusion. But that's not what I have in mind. I'm [referring to the work of] [ingenious innovators] and [tireless researchers] —the men and women of science—who have peeled back layer after layer of the cosmic onion, 剥开 enigma by enigma, 一个接一个的谜 and [revealed a universe] that is at once surprising, unfamiliar, exciting, elegant, and thoroughly unlike what [anyone ever expected].
            - These developments are anything but details. [Breakthroughs in physics] have forced, and continue to force, [dramatic revisions to] [our conception of the cosmos]. [I remain as convinced now as I did decades ago](((1NclXFUpQ))) 我现在仍然像几十年前一样坚信 that Camus rightly chose [life's value]([[life value]]) as the [[ultimate question]], but [the insights of modern physics] [have persuaded me that] [assessing life] [through the lens of everyday experience](((UdMWxhO3l))) is like [gazing at a van Gogh] [through an empty Coke bottle]. [Modern science] has [spearheaded one assault after another] on 率先发起了一次又一次的攻击 [evidence gathered from] our [rudimentary perceptions], 初步认识 showing that they often [yield a clouded conception] of [the world we inhabit]. 模糊的观念 
                - And so whereas Camus [separated out physical questions] and [labeled them secondary], I've [become convinced that] they're primary. For me, [[physical reality]] both sets the arena and [provides the illumination for] [grappling with Camus' question](((IWUCejNez))). [Assessing existence] while failing to [embrace the insights of] [[modern physics]] would be like wrestling in the dark [with an unknown opponent]. 与一个未知的对手摔跤 By [deepening our understanding of] [the true nature of physical reality], we profoundly [reconfigure our sense of ourselves] and [our experience of the universe].
(有关于世界的实在和人生的价值-在这里，物理学问题是第一位的而不是次要的)
210402-19:45
            - The [central concern] of this book is to explain some of [the most prominent and pivotal of these revisions] 枢轴 to our [picture of reality], [with an intense focus on] those that affect our species' [long-term project](((cVQrLCH74))) to [understand space and time]. From Aristotle to Einstein, from the [[astrolabe]] to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], from the pyramids to [mountaintop observatories], space and time have [framed thinking] [since thinking began]. [With the advent of] the [modern scientific age], their importance [has been tremendously heightened]. Over the last three centuries, [developments in physics] have revealed space and time as [the most baffling and most compelling concepts], and as those most instrumental 最重要的工具 in our [scientific analysis] of the universe. Such developments have also shown that space and time [top the list of] age-old [scientific constructs] that are [being fantastically revised by] [[cutting-edge research]].
210402-22:05
- To Isaac Newton, space and time simply were —they formed an inert, universal [cosmic stage] on which [the events of the universe] played themselves out. To [his contemporary and frequent rival](((7cwiz5A7E))) [[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]], "space" and "time" were merely [the vocabulary of relations between] where objects were and [when events took place]. Nothing more. But to Albert Einstein, space and time were the [[raw material]] [underlying reality]. 现实背后的原材料 Through his [theories of relativity], Einstein [jolted our thinking about space and time] and [revealed the principal part] they play in [the evolution of the universe]. Ever since, space and time have been the [sparkling jewels] of physics. They are at once familiar and mystifying; [fully understanding] space and time has become physics' [most daunting challenge] and [sought-after prize].
210402-22:19
    - The developments we'll [cover in this book] [interweave the fabric of] space and time [in various ways]. Some ideas will challenge features of space and time so basic that for centuries, if not millennia, they've [seemed beyond questioning]. Others will [seek the link between] our [theoretical understanding] of space and time and [the traits we commonly experience]. Yet others will [raise questions] unfathomable [within the limited confines of] [ordinary perceptions]. 在普通认知的有限范围内
    - We will speak only [minimally of philosophy] (and not at all about suicide and [the meaning of life]). But in our [scientific quest] to [solve the mysteries of] space and time, we will be resolutely unrestrained. 坚决不受约束 From the universe's [smallest speck] and [earliest moments] [to its farthest reaches] and [most distant future], we will examine space and time in environments familiar and far-flung, [with an unflinching eye] [seeking their true nature]. As the story of space and time [has yet to be fully written], we won't [arrive at any final assessments]. But we will encounter [a series of developments] — some intensely strange, some deeply satisfying, some experimentally verified, some [thoroughly speculative] —that will show how close we've come to wrapping our minds around the fabric of the cosmos and [touching the true texture of reality].

- ## Classical Reality
    - Historians differ on exactly when the [modern scientific age] began, but certainly by the time Galileo Galilei, Rene Descartes, and Isaac Newton had had their say, it was briskly under way. In those days, the [new scientific mind-set] [was being steadily forged], 正在稳步形成 as patterns found in [terrestrial and astronomical data] [made it increasingly clear that] there is an order to [all the comings and goings of the cosmos], an order accessible to [careful reasoning] and [mathematical analysis]. These [early pioneers] of [modem scientific thought] argued that, when [looked at the right way], [the happenings in the universe] not only are [explicable](((HuQjMBc_p))) but predictable. 不仅是可解释的 The power of science to foretell aspects of the future —[consistently](((Zzng80XEW))) and quantitatively—had been revealed.
(宇宙的秩序-可解释+可预测)
210403-00:36
        - Early [scientific study] [focused on the kinds of things] [one might see or experience in everyday life]. Galileo [dropped weights] from a [leaning tower](((7ZeGD8xb4))) (or so legend has it) and watched balls rolling down [[inclined surface]]s; Newton studied [falling apples](((kSS4ljwum))) (or so legend has it) and [the orbit of the moon](((MJdJliZpU))). [The goal of these investigations] was to attune [the nascent scientific ear] 新生的 to [nature's harmonies]. 相协调 To be sure, physical reality was [the stuff of experience], but the challenge was to [hear the rhyme] and [reason behind the rhythm and regularity]. Many sung and unsung heroes contributed to the rapid and [impressive progress] that was made, but Newton [stole the show]. 抢了风头 With a handful of [mathematical equations], he synthesized [everything known about] [motion on earth and in the heavens], and in so doing, [composed the score] for what has come to be known as [[classical physics]]. 
            - In the decades following Newton's work, his equations were developed into [an elaborate mathematical structure] that significantly [extended both their reach and] their [[practical utility]]. Classical physics gradually became a sophisticated and mature [[scientific discipline]]. But shining clearly through all these advances was the beacon of Newton's [original insights]. Even today, more than three hundred years later, you can see [Newton's equations] [scrawled on introductory-physics chalkboards] worldwide, 潦草的笔迹 printed on [NASA flight plans] computing [spacecraft trajectories]([[spacecraft trajectory]]), and embedded within the [complex calculations] of [forefront research].
        - But while [formulating his laws of motion], Newton encountered a critical [stumbling block], one that is of [particular importance] to our story (Chapter 2). Everyone knew that [things could move], but what about the arena [within which the motion took place]? Well, that's space, we'd all answer. But, Newton would reply, what is space? Is space [a real physical entity] or is it [an abstract idea] born of the human struggle to [comprehend the cosmos](((Dl51YOL2m)))? Newton realized that this [key question] had to be answered, because without [taking a stand on] the meaning of space and time, his [equations describing motion] [would prove meaningless]. __Understanding requires context; insight must be anchored. 理解需要语境，洞见必须锚定。__
            - And so, with [a few brief sentences] in his [[Principia Mathematica]], Newton [articulated a conception of] space and time, declaring them [absolute and immutable entities] that [provided the universe with] a rigid, unchangeable arena. According to Newton, space and time supplied [an invisible scaffolding] that [gave the universe shape and structure]. Not everyone agreed. Some [argued persuasively that] [it made little sense to] [ascribe existence to something you can't feel], grasp, or affect. But [the explanatory and predictive power] of [Newton's equations] [quieted the critics]. For the next two hundred years, his [absolute conception of space and time](((s54v9I_DO))) was dogma. 教条

- ## Relativistic Reality
    - The classical [Newtonian worldview](((RU4Ebt98p))) was pleasing. Not only did it describe [natural phenomena] [with striking accuracy], but [the details of the description]—the mathematics —aligned tightly with experience. 紧密结合 If you push something, it speeds up. The harder you [throw a ball], the more impact it has when it [smacks into a wall]. If you [press against something], you feel it [pressing back against you]. The more massive something is, the stronger its gravitational pull. These are among the most [basic properties] of the [natural world], and when you learn [Newton's framework], you see them represented in his equations, clear as day. Unlike a [[crystal ball]]'s [inscrutable hocus-pocus], 难以捉摸的骗术 the workings of [Newton's laws] were on display for all with minimal [mathematical training] to take in fully. Classical physics [provided a rigorous grounding for] [[human intuition]]. p20
210403-07:10
(经典力学同人类的常识与直觉极其相符)
    - Newton had included [the force of gravity] in his equations, but it was not until the 1860s that the [Scottish scientist] [[James Clerk Maxwell]] [extended the framework of] classical physics to [take account of] [electrical and magnetic forces]. Maxwell needed [additional equations] to do so and [the mathematics he employed] [required a higher level of training to grasp fully]. But his new equations were every bit as successful at explaining [electrical and magnetic phenomena] as Newton's were at [describing motion]. By the late 1800s, it was evident that [the universe's secrets] were proving no match for the power of [[human intellectual]] might.
        - Indeed, with the successful [incorporation of electricity and magnetism], [there was a growing sense that] [[theoretical physics]] [would soon be complete]. Physics, some suggested, was rapidly becoming [a finished subject] and its laws would shortly [be chiseled in stone]. 凿刻在石头上 In 1894, the renowned [[experimental physicist]] [[Albert Michelson]] remarked that "most of the [grand underlying principles] [have been firmly established]" and he quoted an "eminent scientist" —most believe it was the British physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] —as saying that [all that remained] were details of [determining some numbers] to [a greater number of decimal places].[1]() In 1900, Kelvin himself did note that "two clouds" were [hovering on the horizon](((k7jc37Ny0))), one to do with [properties of light's motion] and the other with aspects of [the radiation objects emit] when heated/ but there was [a general feeling that] these were mere details, which, no doubt, would soon be addressed.
210403-07:25
        - Within a decade, everything changed. [As anticipated](((BcZVtJZtT))), the two problems Kelvin had raised were [promptly addressed], but they proved anything but minor. Each [ignited a revolution], and each required [a fundamental rewriting of] [nature's laws]. The [classical conceptions] of space, time, and reality—the ones that for hundreds of years had not only worked but also [concisely expressed] our [[intuitive sense]] of the world — were overthrown.
210403-07:31
            - The relativity revolution, which addressed the first of Kelvin's "clouds," dates from 1905 and 1915, when Albert Einstein completed his [special and general theories of relativity] (Chapter 3). While [struggling with puzzles] involving electricity, magnetism, and light's motion, Einstein realized that [Newton's conception of space and time], the corner-stone of classical physics, was flawed. [Over the course of] [a few intense weeks] in the spring of 1905, 度过了紧张的几周 he determined that space and time are not [independent and absolute], as Newton had thought, but are [enmeshed](((Exe9std1T))) and relative [in a manner that] [flies in the face of] 完全违背/相冲突 [[common experience]]. 
                - Some ten years later, Einstein [hammered a final nail in] the Newtonian coffin by [rewriting the laws of] [gravitational physics]. This time, not only did Einstein show that space and time are [part of a unified whole], he also showed that by [warping and curving] 翘曲和弯曲 they participate in [[cosmic evolution]]. Far from being the rigid, [unchanging structures] envisioned by Newton, space and time in Einstein's reworking are [flexible and dynamic].
(时空一体，并且是动态的，参与到宇宙演化的过程中)
210403-12:35
                - The two theories of relativity are among humankind's [most precious achievements], and with them Einstein toppled [Newton's conception of reality]. Even though [Newtonian physics] seemed to capture mathematically much of [what we experience physically], [the reality it describes] [turns out not to be] [the reality of our world]. Ours is a [relativistic reality]. Yet, because [the deviation between] classical and relativistic reality [is manifest only under] [[extreme condition]]s 只在极端条件下才显现出来 (such as extremes of speed and gravity'), Newtonian physics still [provides an approximation] that [proves extremely accurate] and useful [in many circumstances]. But utility and reality' are [very different standards]. As we will see, [features of space and time] that for many of us are [[second nature]] have [turned out to be figments] of [a false Newtonian perspective].
(有用和真实是不同的，经典力学远非真实)
210403-12:48
- ## Quantum Reality
    - [The second anomaly] to which Lord Kelvin referred led to the [quantum revolution], [one of the greatest upheavals](((HdasZzRM7))) to which [modern human understanding] has ever been subjected. By the time [the fires subsided and the smoke cleared], the veneer of 镶饰 classical physics had been singed off [the newly emerging] framework of quantum reality.
    - A [core feature] of classical physics is that if you know [the positions and velocities of all objects] [at a particular moment], [Newton's equations], together with their [Maxwellian updating], can tell you their positions and velocities [at any other moment], past or future. Without equivocation, 毫无疑义 classical physics declares that [the past and future] are [etched into the present]. 过去和未来蚀刻在当下的全部信息中 This feature is also shared by both special and general relativity'. Although the [relativistic concepts] of past and future are subtler than their familiar [classical counterparts] (Chapters 3 and 5), the equations of relativity, together with [a complete assessment of the present](((oJm6uPeMT))), [determine them just as completely](((Jm21PfeI6))).
210403-13:01
    - By the 1930s, however, physicists were forced to introduce a whole new [[conceptual schema]] called quantum mechanics. Quite unexpectedly, they found that only [quantum laws] were capable of [resolving a host of puzzles] and [explaining a variety of data] [newly acquired from] [the atomic and subatomic realm]. But according to the quantum laws, even if you [make the most perfect measurements] possible of how things are today, [the best you can ever hope to do] is [predict the probability] that [things will be one way or another] [at some chosen time] [in the future], or that things were one way or another at some chosen time [in the past]. The universe, according to quantum mechanics, is not [etched into the present]; the universe, according to quantum mechanics, participates in [a game of chance]. 
        - Although [there is still controversy over] precisely [how these developments should be interpreted], most physicists agree that probability is deeply [woven into the fabric of quantum reality]. Whereas human intuition, and its [embodiment](((xvXO0Yyt3))) in classical physics, envision a reality in which [things are always definitely one way or another], quantum mechanics [describes a reality] in which things sometimes [hover in a haze of] 阴霾中徘徊 [being partly one way and partly another]. [Things become definite only when] [a suitable observation] [forces them to relinquish quantum possibilities] and [settle on a specific outcome]. The outcome that's realized, though, [cannot be predicted](((YBrPAaTiz))) —[we can predict only the odds that](((1G-_MOIj_))) [things will turn out one way or another].
        - This, plainly speaking, is weird. We are unused to a reality' [that](((GrTk7D5vC))) [remains ambiguous until perceived](((atYFEHIu3))). But the oddity of quantum mechanics [does not stop here]. At least [as astounding is a feature that] goes back to a paper Einstein wrote in 1935 with two younger colleagues, Nathan Rosen and Boris Podolsky, that was [intended as an attack on] quantum theory.[3] With the [ensuing twists] of [scientific progress], 接踵而来的扭曲 Einstein's paper can now be viewed as among the first to point out that quantum mechanics — if taken at face value —implies that [something you do over here] [can be instantaneously linked to] [something happening over there], regardless of distance. 
            - Einstein considered such [instantaneous connections](((RAGMj5hJQ))) ludicrous and [interpreted their emergence from] [the mathematics of quantum theory] as evidence that the theory was [in need of much development] before it would [attain an acceptable form]. But by the 1980s, when [both theoretical and technological developments] [brought experimental scrutiny to](((SlUmAAigy))) 实验性的检验 bear on these [purported quantum absurdities], 所谓的量子佯谬 [researchers confirmed that] there can be [an instantaneous bond between] [what happens at widely separated locations]. Under pristine laboratory conditions, [what Einstein thought absurd] really happens (Chapter 4).

            - He added that if reports are [taken at face value] 从表面上来看 they showed [[extraterrestrial vehicle]]s 外星人使用的交通工具 [had a very wide range of speeds] and are [stealthy](((3oPmWzmKs))). www.[i21st].cn
        - [The implications of these features] of quantum mechanics for our [picture of reality] are a subject of [ongoing research]. Many scientists, myself included, [view them as part of] [a radical quantum updating of] the meaning and [properties of space]. Normally, [spatial separation] implies [physical independence](((hAE8Guryc))). If you [want to control what's happening] [on the other side of a football field], you have to go there, or, at the very least, you have to [send someone or something] (the assistant coach, [bouncing air molecules] [conveying speech], [a flash of light] to [get someone's attention], etc.) [across the field] to [convey your influence]. If you don't—if you remain [spatially isolated](((tpJEQ3DRd)))—you will [have no impact], since [intervening space](((pB4Siz-8d))) [ensures the absence of] a [physical connection]. 
            - Quantum mechanics [challenges this view] by revealing, at least [in certain circumstances], a capacity to transcend space; [long-range quantum connections](((f0wowQqc-))) can [bypass spatial separation]. Two objects can be [far apart in space], but as far as quantum mechanics is concerned, it's as if they're a [single entity](((jCeru4_Hj))). Moreover, because of [the tight link between] space and time found by Einstein, the [quantum connections] also have [temporal tentacles]. 时间上的约束 We'll shortly encounter some clever and [truly wondrous experiments] that have recently explored a number of the startling 惊人的 [spatiotemporal interconnections](((M45eYuXGe))) entailed by quantum mechanics and, as we'll see, they 强有力地 forcefully challenge the classical, [intuitive worldview] [many of us hold].
(经典物理学中，空间上的分离意味着彼此间的独立性，任何相关性都需要物理实体之间的空间上的接触来传递)

    - Despite these many [impressive insights], there remains one very [basic feature] of time —that it seems to [have a direction](((uFxRBoUGx))) [pointing from past to future] —for which neither relativity nor quantum mechanics has [provided an explanation]. Instead, the only [convincing progress] has come from [research in an area of physics] called [[cosmology]].

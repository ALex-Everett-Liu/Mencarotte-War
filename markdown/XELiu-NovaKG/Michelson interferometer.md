    - In a Michelson interferometer [adapted for FTIR], light from the polychromatic [[infrared source]], 多色 approximately a [[black-body radiator]], is [collimated](((9lctvsya6))) and directed to a [[beam splitter]]. Ideally [50% of the light] is [refracted towards] the [[fixed mirror]] and 50% is [transmitted towards] the [[moving mirror]]. Light is [reflected from the two mirrors back to] the beam splitter and [some fraction of the original light] passes into the [[sample compartment]]. There, the light is [focused on the sample]. On leaving the sample compartment the light is [refocused on to the detector]. The difference in [optical path length] [between the two arms] to the interferometer is known as the [[retardation]] or [[optical path difference (OPD)]]. 
        - An interferogram is obtained by [varying the retardation] and [recording the signal from the detector] [for various values of the retardation]. [The form of the interferogram] [when no sample is present] [depends on factors such as] the variation of [source intensity] and [splitter efficiency with wavelength]. This results in a maximum at [[zero retardation]], when there is [[constructive interference]] [at all wavelengths], followed by series of "wiggles". 摆动 [The position of zero retardation] is [determined accurately by] [finding the point of] [maximum intensity] in the interferogram. [When a sample is present] the [[background interferogram]] is modulated by the presence of [[absorption band]]s in the sample.

    - [Commercial spectrometers] use Michelson interferometers with a variety of [scanning mechanisms] to [generate the path difference]. [Common to all these arrangements is] [the need to ensure that] [the two beams recombine exactly as the system scans]. The [simplest systems] have a [[plane mirror]] that [moves linearly] to [vary the path of one beam]. [In this arrangement] the [moving mirror] [must not tilt or wobble] 倾斜或摆动 as this would [affect how the beams overlap as they recombine]. Some systems [incorporate a compensating mechanism] that [automatically adjusts the orientation of one mirror] to [maintain the alignment]. Arrangements that [avoid this problem] include using [cube corner reflectors] instead of plane mirrors as these [have the property of] [returning any incident beam] [in a parallel direction] regardless of orientation.

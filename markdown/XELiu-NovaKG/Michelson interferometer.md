    - In a Michelson interferometer [adapted for FTIR], light from the polychromatic [[infrared source]], 多色 approximately a [[black-body radiator]], is [collimated](((9lctvsya6))) and directed to a [[beam splitter]]. Ideally [50% of the light] is [refracted towards] the [[fixed mirror]] and 50% is [transmitted towards] the [[moving mirror]]. Light is [reflected from the two mirrors back to] the beam splitter and [some fraction of the original light] passes into the [[sample compartment]]. There, the light is [focused on the sample]. On leaving the sample compartment the light is [refocused on to the detector]. The difference in [optical path length] [between the two arms] to the interferometer is known as the [[retardation]] or [[optical path difference (OPD)]]. 
        - An interferogram is obtained by [varying the retardation] and [recording the signal from the detector] [for various values of the retardation]. [The form of the interferogram] [when no sample is present] [depends on factors such as] the variation of [source intensity] and [splitter efficiency with wavelength]. This results in a maximum at [[zero retardation]], when there is [[constructive interference]] [at all wavelengths], followed by series of "wiggles". 摆动 [The position of zero retardation] is [determined accurately by] [finding the point of] [maximum intensity] in the interferogram. [When a sample is present] the [[background interferogram]] is modulated by the presence of [[absorption band]]s in the sample.

    - [Commercial spectrometers] use Michelson interferometers with a variety of [scanning mechanisms] to [generate the path difference]. [Common to all these arrangements is] [the need to ensure that] [the two beams recombine exactly as the system scans]. The [simplest systems] have a [[plane mirror]] that [moves linearly] to [vary the path of one beam]. [In this arrangement] the [moving mirror] [must not tilt or wobble] 倾斜或摆动 as this would [affect how the beams overlap as they recombine]. Some systems [incorporate a compensating mechanism] that [automatically adjusts the orientation of one mirror] to [maintain the alignment]. Arrangements that [avoid this problem] include using [cube corner reflectors] instead of plane mirrors as these [have the property of] [returning any incident beam] [in a parallel direction] regardless of orientation.

    - # 基于[无定镜](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN106153196A/zh)迈克尔逊干涉仪的傅里叶变换光谱仪
        - 傅里叶变换光谱仪 (Fourier Transform Spectrometer, FTS) 按照结构和调制方式可分为时间调制型和空间调制型，时间调制型FTS是通过增加[运动部件][让两光路经过的路程不同]或[所用时间不同][来产生光程差][从而形成干涉]的，__空间调制型FTS是通过[光照射空间中不同位置的点]来产生光程差形成干涉的。__与时间调制型FTS相比，空间调制型FTS[更为稳定]、体积也更小，因为它内部没有[运动器件]; 但是时间调制型FTS—般具有更高的[探测信噪比]和更宽的[探测带宽]，因而应用更为广泛。
        - 本发明[去除了定镜]，采用[双面反射动镜]，[光源发出的光][经分束器得到两束光]，这两束光[离开分束器后][再回到分束器][所经过的距离之差][即为光程差]，本发明中，双面反射动镜[每移动一段距离]，[所产生的光程差][为该距离的四倍]。

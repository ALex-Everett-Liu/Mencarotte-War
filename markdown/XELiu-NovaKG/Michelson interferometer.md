    - In a Michelson interferometer [adapted for FTIR], light from the polychromatic [[infrared source]], 多色 approximately a [[black-body radiator]], is [collimated](((9lctvsya6))) and directed to a [[beam splitter]]. Ideally [50% of the light] is [refracted towards] the [[fixed mirror]] and 50% is [transmitted towards] the [[moving mirror]]. Light is [reflected from the two mirrors back to] the beam splitter and [some fraction of the original light] passes into the [[sample compartment]]. There, the light is [focused on the sample]. On leaving the sample compartment the light is [refocused on to the detector]. The difference in [optical path length] [between the two arms] to the interferometer is known as the [[retardation]] or [[optical path difference (OPD)]]. 
        - An interferogram is obtained by [varying the retardation] and [recording the signal from the detector] [for various values of the retardation]. [The form of the interferogram] [when no sample is present] [depends on factors such as] the variation of [source intensity] and [splitter efficiency with wavelength]. This results in a maximum at [[zero retardation]], when there is [[constructive interference]] [at all wavelengths], followed by series of "wiggles". 摆动 The position of zero retardation is determined accurately by finding the point of maximum intensity in the interferogram. When a sample is present the background interferogram is modulated by the presence of absorption bands in the sample.

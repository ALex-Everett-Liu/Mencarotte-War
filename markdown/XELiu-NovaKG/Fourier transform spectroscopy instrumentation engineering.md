        - This book covers the [engineering aspects] of [Michelson-interferometer-based] Fourier-transform (FT) spectrometers. While other Fourier-transform spectroscopy [[textbook]]s [have generally focused on] the [theoretical aspects] and applications, [this book provides insights to] [the design and instrumentation of] [FT spectrometers]. [This book is intended for scientists and engineers] who wish to [understand the operation of the instrument] to the extent where they [have the knowledge to] [improve results through hardware], software and/or [procedural modifications]. This book is also [a proper introductory text for] an engineer who [plans to design a custom] FT spectrometer.

        - [Many applications today require] the [Fourier-transform (FT) spectrometer] to [perform close to its limitations], such as [taking many quantitative measurements in] the visible and [in the near infrared wavelength regions]. In such cases, [the instrument should not be considered as](((dq9FUXSTO))) [a perfect 'black box']. ^^Knowing [where the limitations of performance arise] and [which components must be improved]^^ are crucial to [obtaining repeatable and accurate results]. [One of the objectives of this book is to] [help the user] [identify the instrument's bottleneck]. #[[repeatability]] #[[accuracy]]

        - The book begins with an overview of the types of spectrometers and the fundamental advantages of FT spectrometers (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 is devoted to clearly defining signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a performance figure extensively used throughout this book. In Chapter 3, details of the interferometer operation are discussed. The design and limitations of the subsystems and components that include the motion components, the analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion process, the detection system, and the optical components are covered in Chapters 4 through 9. Chapter 10 introduces various practical techniques to identify the limiting source of error, and techniques to improve the obtainable SNR.
        - I am indebted to Professor Kamal Youcef-Toumi at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for giving me the opportunities to be involved in various first-rate R&D projects during my time at MIT, one of which led me to the exciting world of FT spectroscopy. I deeply thank Merry Schnell of SPIE, the main editor of this project, for her thoroughness and professionalism. Bradley M. Stone and David Ball did an excellent job in reviewing the original manuscript. Rick Hermann and Timothy Lamkins of SPIE provided generous assistance from the early stage of the project. All have my deepest appreciation.

        - 1.1 Introduction / 1
            - Fourier-transform spectrometers (FTS or FT spectrometers) have been replacing the dispersive instruments in many infrared and near-infrared applications over the last couple of decades. Their inherent advantages compared with the dispersive instruments are proven and well accepted by scientists and engineers working in the field of spectroscopy. This chapter provides a general overview of the types of spectrometers commonly used today, focusing on the differences in their operating principles. An analysis of an FT spectrometer’s advantages over its dispersive counterpart is then presented.

            - 1.2.2 Filter-based spectrometers
                - [[filter-based spectrometer]]s, [or often simply called] filter spectrometers, use one or more [[absorption filter]] or [[interference filter]]s to [transmit the selected range of wavelength], as illustrated in Fig. 1.2. As the beam [passes through the filter], some of its [spectral components] are [blocked through an absorption or interference process], while the [desired spectral elements] are transmitted. Various interference filters, from the ultraviolet through the [far-infrared region], in various dimensions, are available as [commercial-off-the-shelf items](((Qn9Sf0NaX))) (e.g., Spectrogon AB, Taby, Sweden, and CVI Laser Corp., Albuquerque, NM, USA).

        - 1.3 Advantages of FT Spectrometers
            - There are a number of [acclaimed and widely publicized advantages] of FT spectrometers [when compared with their dispersive counterparts]. However, [only those advantages inherent to] FT spectrometers’ [operating principles] rather than [particular engineering designs] are [discussed here]. They are known as the throughput (Jacquinot) and the multiplex (Felgett) advantages.
            - Because [filter instruments] do not offer the kind of [[spectral range]], [[spectral resolution]], and [[versatility]] that FTS and [grating instruments] do [they are not included in this comparison]. [It would be unfair to weigh] the [“higher-performing” instruments] against the [filter instruments].
220413-16:53
            - The following discussions, although placed in the first chapter of the book, will better serve their purpose if the reader is already familiar with FTS operation. The throughput advantage discussions require familiarity with the finite spectral resolution imposed by the finite divergence angle of the beam entering the interferometer, covered in Sec. 3.3.2. Discussion of the multiplex advantage discussions requires knowledge of the spectrum generation from the interferogram illustrated throughout Chapter 3. Therefore, the reader who is unfamiliar with these subjects is advised to read Chapter 3 before continuing.
        - 1.4 Discussion on FT Spectrometer Advantages
            - [The actual SNR improvements] obtained by an FT spectrometer depend on various other [instrumental and procedural factors]. In some measurements, [none of the advantages] of FT spectrometers [may really apply]. The various sources of noise and errors that may limit the achievable spectral SNR obtainable by FT instruments is discussed later. It is one of the goals of this book to equip the reader with enough knowledge about the design and the instrumentation aspects of FT spectrometers to be able to critically evaluate their tangible benefits for the actual applications.
            - As a brief illustration, consider an application in the visible and/or the near- infrared range (~400 to ~2500 nm). For measurements in such a high wave number (short wavelength) radiation, the FT spectrometer requires a high- precision mirror drive and an extremely accurate interferogram data sampling, which will be discussed in Chapters 4 and 6, respectively. Otherwise, the resulting spectral SNR is very low. If spectral SNR is indeed limited by the quality of the mirror drive or the data sampling accuracy, none of the FT spectrometer’s advantages previously discussed applies. Thus, in order to improve the SNR, better motion- and data-clocking systems should be used. In this case, one needs to carefully assess the benefits of using an expensive, “high-performance” FT spectrometer compared with a less expensive, grating-based instrument. The deciding factor may be the resolution required and the wavelength range to be measured at a given time, which translates to the number of spectral elements. With a large number of spectral elements, the multiplex advantage may be necessary or highly beneficial. The throughput advantage is also relevant if the radiation source is weak.

    - Chapter 2 Signal-to-Noise Ratio
        - To quantify the instrument’s [[performance]], the spectral [[signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]] is used as the [main measure]([[measure]]) [throughout this book]. The term has been used [somewhat inconsistently]; in some cases, it is used to quantify spectral [[repeatability]], and in others, it is used to quantify spectral [[accuracy]]. Thus, [it is appropriate to start with] [a clear definition of the term] as it [applies throughout this book].

        - 2.1 Signal-to-Noise Ratio Defined
            - In this book, ^^the SNR [measures the instrument’s ability to] [reproduce the spectrum from the same sample], the same conditions, and the same [instrumental configurations] [over a certain amount of time].^^ This, in fact, is a measure of [spectral repeatability], which measures [the ability of the instrument to] [detect certain changes in the spectrum] [such as those caused by changes in] the sample’s [spectral characteristics]. Therefore, [[noise]] is the measure of [the spectral deviations between measurements]([[deviation]]), regardless of [the output spectrum’s proximity to the “true” value]([[proximity]]).
(FTIR的噪声衡量的是不同次测量之间的偏差，而非与理想条件真实值间的偏差)
            - Accuracy, on the other hand, is a measure of [the discrepancy between] the [actual measured value] and [the “true” standard or calibrated value]. [[wavelength accuracy]] of a spectrometer is crucial. It is important for the instrument to be able to [conform to the “calibrated standard”] in [producing wavelength information] [within the instrument’s intended resolution]([[resolution]]). For example, if the true [[absorption peak]] of molecule x is 4000.2 nm, [the instrument should be able to] [give the correct peak wavelength information] [within its designed resolution]. Thus, following the example, if the instrument has a [designed resolution] of 1 nm, then it should [register the peak] of molecule x at 4000 nm. This is required for [proper information transfer between instruments].

        - 2.3 Practical Considerations
            - The [SNR value] depends on many [[experimental factor]]s as well as [[instrumental configuration]]s, including the [averaging and integrating time], the [[radiation power]] that [falls on the detector], the [[spectral range]] observed, [the diameter of the beam] [entering the interferometer], etc., as is demonstrated throughout this book. Thus, [one needs to be aware of] and [take into account] these conditions when [reporting the SNR value of an instrument] or when [evaluating the manufacturer’s specified SNR].
220413-23:03
            - [It is highly recommended that] one [perform an experimental SNR measurement] [under the same conditions](((y52TFGPsf))) or instrumental configurations [as those to be used in the real measurement]. Consider as an example, a near-infrared instrument used to measure an analyte in a water solution. Measuring the SNR by taking single-beam spectra of the background air (to obtain the 100% line) is not appropriate since the transmitted spectral range, the transmitted power radiation, and the aperture setting most likely differ from those used in the actual measurements of the analyte. Evaluating the SNR with use of a controlled, aqueous solution or a set of appropriate optical filters to replicate the real conditions produces a more meaningful result.
    - Chapter 3 Principles of Interferometer Operation
        - The interferometer is the core of every Fourier-transform spectrometer. Today’s FT spectrometers [use a variety of interferometer designs]. However, they are all still based on the simple, yet historically most important, [[Michelson interferometer]].
            - In this chapter, the operating principle of the Michelson interferometer for FT spectroscopy is discussed. It is the objective of this chapter to provide a thorough physical understanding of how a spectrum is generated in an FT spectrometer. Enough mathematics is used to aid comprehension. First, a qualitative overview is provided, which is followed by a more detailed explanation starting with the wave description of light. Then, the factors that limit the output spectral resolution are explored, and finally, the interferogram processing techniques sometimes necessary to obtain accurate spectra are briefly discussed.

            - 3.2.1 Light as a wave
                - To fully understand [[light interference]] and [[interferogram]] generation, light as an [[electromagnetic wave]] must be considered. A [[monochromatic light]] [contains a single-frequency wave], though no [real waves] are [truly monochromatic]. A source that [contains a narrow enough band of frequencies] and is [stable for a long enough period] is [a practical definition of] monochromatic light. For this discussion, sources such as [[helium-neon laser]]s that emit a single [[spectral peak]] are [considered monochromatic]. 
                    - [A traveling monochromatic wave] with speed v [in the positive z- direction] [can be represented mathematically by] 
$$U(z, t)=A \sin k(z-v t)$$ (3.1)
                - Figure 3.5(a) shows the [temporal magnitude fluctuation] of the [[monochromatic wave]] (as a function of time), with frequency f. Figure 3.5(b) shows the [[wavefront]]s [at a snapshot of time]([[snapshot]]). Each wavefront is [separated from the next by] λ. The frequency f and the wavelength λ of the wave are related by

            - 3.2.2 Measurable light quantity
                - Eventually, the radiation power is converted into an electrical signal at the photo- detector that can then be processed, digitized, and stored. The question now is, what does the detector measure? After all, if the wave’s electric or magnetic field temporal variations could be measured, there would be no need to use interferometry to create modulation through interference in the first place. It is possible to have obtained its spectrum simply by Fourier transforming the recorded signal as a function of time. However, no current detectors exist that have a high enough bandwidth to detect the high frequency of light (1000-nm light has a temporal frequency of ~3 × 10 14 Hz).

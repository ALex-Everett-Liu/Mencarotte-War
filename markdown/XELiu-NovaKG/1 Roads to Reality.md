- None of the books in my father's [dusty old bookcase] were forbidden. Yet while I was growing up, I never saw anyone [take one down]. Most were [massive tomes] —a comprehensive history of civilization, matching volumes of the great works of [[western literature]], numerous others I can no longer recall —that seemed [almost fused to shelves] that [bowed slightly] 微微弯曲 from decades of [steadfast support]. But way up on the highest shelf was [a thin little text] that, every now and then, would [catch my eye] because it [seemed so out of place], like Gulliver among the Brobdingnagians. In hindsight, [I'm not quite sure] why I [waited so long] before [taking a look]. Perhaps, as the years went by, the books seemed less like [material you read] and more like [family heirlooms] 传家宝 you [admire from afar]. Ultimately, such reverence [gave way to teenage brashness]. 让位于青少年的鲁莽 I reached up for the little text, dusted it off, and opened to page one. The first few lines were, to say the least, startling.
    - My [chance encounter] with Camus' book must have occurred during [an especially impressionable phase] because, more than anything else I'd read, his words [stayed with me]. [Time and again] I'd imagine how various people I'd met, or heard about, or [had seen on television] would [answer this primary of all questions]. In retrospect, though, 回想起来 it was his second assertion—regarding the role of [[scientific progress]] —that, for me, proved particularly challenging. Camus acknowledged value in understanding [the structure of the universe], but as far as I could tell, he [rejected the possibility that] such understanding could [make any difference to] our [assessment of life's worth]. Now, certainly, my [teenage reading] of [[existential philosophy]] was about as sophisticated as Bart Simpson's reading of [[Romantic poetry]], but even so, Camus' conclusion struck me as off the mark. 给我留下了深刻的印象 To this aspiring physicist, 抱负, 志气 it seemed that [an informed appraisal of life] 知情评估 absolutely [required a full understanding of] [life's arena] —the universe. 
        - [I remember thinking that] if our species dwelled in [cavernous outcroppings] 出露地表, 矿苗 [buried deep underground] and so had yet to [discover the earth's surface], brilliant sunlight, an ocean breeze, and the stars that lie beyond, or if evolution had [proceeded along a different pathway] and we had yet to acquire any but [the sense of touch], so [everything we knew] came only from our [tactile impressions](((bhJr1gK90))) 触觉印象 of our [immediate environment], or if human mental faculties [stopped developing during early childhood] so our [emotional and analytical skills] [never progressed beyond] those of a five-year-old —in short, ^^如果我们的一切经历都只能是对真正实在的微不足道的描绘 if our experiences painted but [a paltry portrait of reality]—[our appraisal of life] [would be thoroughly compromised].^^ When we finally [found our way to] [earth's surface], or when we finally [gained the ability to] see, hear, smell, and taste, or when our minds were finally freed to develop [as they ordinarily do], our [[collective view]] of life and the cosmos would, of necessity, change radically. Our previously [compromised grasp of reality] would have [shed a very different light on] that [most fundamental of] all [philosophical questions].
        - But, you might ask, what of it? Surely, any [[sober assessment]] would conclude that although we might not [understand everything about the universe] — every aspect of [how matter behaves] or [life functions] —we are privy to the defining, broad-brush strokes gracing nature's canvas. Surely, as Camus intimated, progress in physics, such as understanding the number of [[space dimension]]s; or progress in [[neuropsychology]], such as understanding all the [[organizational structure]]s in the brain; or, for that matter, progress in any number of other [scientific undertakings] may [fill in important details], but their impact on our [evaluation of life] and reality would be minimal. Surely, reality is what we think it is; reality is [revealed to us by our experiences].
        - To one extent or another, this [view of reality] is one many of us hold, if only implicitly. I certainly find myself [thinking this way] [in day-to-day life](((iyx40cLCP))); [it's easy to be seduced by] 所诱惑 the face nature reveals directly to our senses. Yet, in the decades [since first encountering] Camus' text, I've learned that [modern science] [tells a very different story]. The [overarching lesson] that has emerged from [[scientific inquiry]] [over the last century] is that [[human experience]] is often [a misleading guide to] [the true nature of reality](((4p5xu9TI0))). Lying just beneath [the surface of the everyday] is [a world we'd hardly recognize]. Followers of the [[occult]], devotees of [[astrology]], 虔诚的宗教信徒 and those who hold to [religious principles] that speak to [a reality beyond experience] have, from widely varying perspectives, long since arrived at a similar conclusion. But that's not what I have in mind. I'm [referring to the work of] [ingenious innovators] and [tireless researchers] —the men and women of science—who have peeled back layer after layer of the cosmic onion, 剥开 enigma by enigma, 一个接一个的谜 and [revealed a universe] that is at once surprising, unfamiliar, exciting, elegant, and thoroughly unlike what [anyone ever expected].
            - These developments are anything but details. [Breakthroughs in physics] have forced, and continue to force, [dramatic revisions to] [our conception of the cosmos]. [I remain as convinced now as I did decades ago](((1NclXFUpQ))) 我现在仍然像几十年前一样坚信 that Camus rightly chose [life's value]([[life value]]) as the [[ultimate question]], but [the insights of modern physics] [have persuaded me that] [assessing life] [through the lens of everyday experience](((SNT2aWXhI))) is like [gazing at a van Gogh] [through an empty Coke bottle]. [Modern science] has [spearheaded one assault after another] on 率先发起了一次又一次的攻击 [evidence gathered from] our [rudimentary perceptions], 初步认识 showing that they often [yield a clouded conception] of [the world we inhabit]. 模糊的观念 
                - And so whereas Camus [separated out physical questions] and [labeled them secondary], I've [become convinced that] they're primary. For me, [[physical reality]] both sets the arena and [provides the illumination for] [grappling with Camus' question]. 抓住, 扭打 [Assessing existence] while failing to [embrace the insights of] [[modern physics]] would be like wrestling in the dark [with an unknown opponent]. 与一个未知的对手摔跤 By [deepening our understanding of] [the true nature of physical reality], we profoundly [reconfigure our sense of ourselves] and [our experience of the universe].

            - The [central concern] of this book is to explain some of [the most prominent and pivotal of these revisions] 枢轴 to our [picture of reality], [with an intense focus on] those that affect our species' [long-term project](((6h4yMRsHy))) to [understand space and time]. From Aristotle to Einstein, from the [[astrolabe]] to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], from the pyramids to [mountaintop observatories], space and time have [framed thinking] [since thinking began]. [With the advent of] the [modern scientific age], their importance [has been tremendously heightened]. Over the last three centuries, [developments in physics] have revealed space and time as [the most baffling and most compelling concepts], and as those most instrumental 最重要的工具 in our [scientific analysis] of the universe. Such developments have also shown that space and time [top the list of] age-old [scientific constructs] that are [being fantastically revised by] [[cutting-edge research]].

- To Isaac Newton, space and time simply were —they formed an inert, universal [cosmic stage] 惰性的 on which [the events of the universe] played themselves out. To his contemporary and frequent rival 竞争对手 [[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]], "space" and "time" were merely [the vocabulary of relations between] where objects were and [when events took place]. Nothing more. But to Albert Einstein, space and time were the [[raw material]] underlying reality. 现实背后的原材料 Through his [theories of relativity], Einstein [jolted our thinking about space and time] and [revealed the principal part] they play in [the evolution of the universe]. Ever since, space and time have been the [sparkling jewels] of physics. They are at once familiar and mystifying; [fully understanding] space and time has become physics' [most daunting challenge] and [sought-after prize].
210402-22:19
    - The developments we'll [cover in this book] [interweave the fabric of] space and time [in various ways]. Some ideas will challenge features of space and time so basic that for centuries, if not millennia, they've [seemed beyond questioning]. Others will [seek the link between] our [theoretical understanding] of space and time and [the traits we commonly experience]. Yet others will raise questions unfathomable within the limited confines of ordinary perceptions.

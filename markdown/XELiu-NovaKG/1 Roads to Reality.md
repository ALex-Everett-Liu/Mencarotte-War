- None of the books in my father's [dusty old bookcase] were forbidden. Yet while I was growing up, I never saw anyone [take one down]. Most were [massive tomes] —a comprehensive history of civilization, matching volumes of the great works of [[western literature]], numerous others I can no longer recall —that seemed [almost fused to shelves] that [bowed slightly] 微微弯曲 from decades of [steadfast support]. But way up on the highest shelf was [a thin little text] that, every now and then, would [catch my eye] because it [seemed so out of place], like Gulliver among the Brobdingnagians. In hindsight, [I'm not quite sure] why I [waited so long] before [taking a look]. Perhaps, as the years went by, the books seemed less like [material you read] and more like [family heirlooms] 传家宝 you [admire from afar]. Ultimately, such reverence [gave way to teenage brashness]. 让位于青少年的鲁莽 I reached up for the little text, dusted it off, and opened to page one. The first few lines were, to say the least, startling.
    - My [chance encounter] with Camus' book must have occurred during [an especially impressionable phase] because, more than anything else I'd read, his words [stayed with me]. [Time and again] I'd imagine how various people I'd met, or heard about, or [had seen on television] would [answer this primary of all questions]. In retrospect, though, 回想起来 it was his second assertion—regarding the role of [[scientific progress]] —that, for me, proved particularly challenging. Camus acknowledged value in understanding [the structure of the universe], but as far as I could tell, he [rejected the possibility that] such understanding could [make any difference to] our [assessment of life's worth]. Now, certainly, my [teenage reading] of [[existential philosophy]] was about as sophisticated as Bart Simpson's reading of [[Romantic poetry]], but even so, Camus' conclusion struck me as off the mark. 给我留下了深刻的印象 To this aspiring physicist, 抱负, 志气 it seemed that [an informed appraisal of life] 知情评估 absolutely [required a full understanding of] [life's arena] —the universe. 
        - [I remember thinking that] if our species dwelled in [cavernous outcroppings] 出露地表, 矿苗 [buried deep underground] and so had yet to [discover the earth's surface], brilliant sunlight, an ocean breeze, and the stars that lie beyond, or if evolution had [proceeded along a different pathway] and we had yet to acquire any but [the sense of touch], so [everything we knew] came only from our [tactile impressions](((bhJr1gK90))) 触觉印象 of our [immediate environment], or if human mental faculties [stopped developing during early childhood] so our [emotional and analytical skills] [never progressed beyond] those of a five-year-old —in short, ^^如果我们的一切经历都只能是对真正实在的微不足道的描绘 if our experiences painted but [a paltry portrait of reality]—[our appraisal of life] [would be thoroughly compromised].^^ When we finally [found our way to] [earth's surface], or when we finally [gained the ability to] see, hear, smell, and taste, or when our minds were finally freed to develop [as they ordinarily do], our [[collective view]] of life and the cosmos would, of necessity, change radically. Our previously [compromised grasp of reality] would have [shed a very different light on] that [most fundamental of] all [philosophical questions].

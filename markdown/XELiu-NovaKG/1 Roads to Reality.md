- None of the books in my father's [dusty old bookcase] were forbidden. Yet while I was growing up, I never saw anyone [take one down]. Most were [massive tomes] —a comprehensive history of civilization, matching volumes of the great works of [[western literature]], numerous others I can no longer recall —that seemed [almost fused to shelves] that [bowed slightly] 微微弯曲 from decades of [steadfast support]. But way up on the highest shelf was [a thin little text] that, every now and then, would [catch my eye] because it [seemed so out of place], like Gulliver among the Brobdingnagians. In hindsight, [I'm not quite sure] why I [waited so long] before [taking a look]. Perhaps, as the years went by, the books seemed less like [material you read] and more like [family heirlooms] 传家宝 you [admire from afar]. Ultimately, such reverence [gave way to teenage brashness]. 让位于青少年的鲁莽 I reached up for the little text, dusted it off, and opened to page one. The first few lines were, to say the least, startling.
    - My [chance encounter] with Camus' book must have occurred during [an especially impressionable phase] because, more than anything else I'd read, his words [stayed with me]. [Time and again] I'd imagine how various people I'd met, or heard about, or [had seen on television] would [answer this primary of all questions]. In retrospect, though, 回想起来 it was his second assertion—regarding the role of [[scientific progress]] —that, for me, proved particularly challenging. Camus acknowledged value in understanding [the structure of the universe], but as far as I could tell, he [rejected the possibility that] such understanding could [make any difference to] our [assessment of life's worth]. Now, certainly, my [teenage reading] of [[existential philosophy]] was about as sophisticated as Bart Simpson's reading of [[Romantic poetry]], but even so, Camus' conclusion struck me as off the mark. 给我留下了深刻的印象 To this aspiring physicist, 抱负, 志气 it seemed that [an informed appraisal of life] 知情评估 absolutely [required a full understanding of] [life's arena] —the universe. 
        - [I remember thinking that] if our species dwelled in [cavernous outcroppings] 出露地表, 矿苗 [buried deep underground] and so had yet to [discover the earth's surface], brilliant sunlight, an ocean breeze, and the stars that lie beyond, or if evolution had [proceeded along a different pathway] and we had yet to acquire any but [the sense of touch], so [everything we knew] came only from our [tactile impressions](((bhJr1gK90))) 触觉印象 of our [immediate environment], or if human mental faculties [stopped developing during early childhood] so our [emotional and analytical skills] [never progressed beyond] those of a five-year-old —in short, ^^如果我们的一切经历都只能是对真正实在的微不足道的描绘 if our experiences painted but [a paltry portrait of reality]—[our appraisal of life] [would be thoroughly compromised].^^ When we finally [found our way to] [earth's surface], or when we finally [gained the ability to] see, hear, smell, and taste, or when our minds were finally freed to develop [as they ordinarily do], our [[collective view]] of life and the cosmos would, of necessity, change radically. Our previously [compromised grasp of reality] would have [shed a very different light on] that [most fundamental of] all [philosophical questions].
        - But, you might ask, what of it? Surely, any [[sober assessment]] would conclude that although we might not [understand everything about the universe] — every aspect of [how matter behaves] or [life functions] —we are privy to the defining, broad-brush strokes gracing nature's canvas. Surely, as Camus intimated, progress in physics, such as understanding the number of [[space dimension]]s; or progress in [[neuropsychology]], such as understanding all the [[organizational structure]]s in the brain; or, for that matter, progress in any number of other [scientific undertakings] may [fill in important details], but their impact on our [evaluation of life] and reality would be minimal. Surely, reality is what we think it is; reality is [revealed to us by our experiences].
        - To one extent or another, this [view of reality] is one many of us hold, if only implicitly. I certainly find myself [thinking this way] [in day-to-day life](((iyx40cLCP))); [it's easy to be seduced by] 所诱惑 the face nature reveals directly to our senses. Yet, in the decades [since first encountering] Camus' text, I've learned that [modern science] [tells a very different story]. The [overarching lesson] that has emerged from [[scientific inquiry]] [over the last century] is that [[human experience]] is often [a misleading guide to] [the true nature of reality](((4p5xu9TI0))). Lying just beneath [the surface of the everyday] is [a world we'd hardly recognize]. Followers of the [[occult]], devotees of [[astrology]], 虔诚的宗教信徒 and those who hold to [religious principles] that speak to [a reality beyond experience] have, from widely varying perspectives, long since arrived at a similar conclusion. But that's not what I have in mind. I'm [referring to the work of] [ingenious innovators] and [tireless researchers] —the men and women of science—who have peeled back layer after layer of the cosmic onion, 剥开 enigma by enigma, 一个接一个的谜 and [revealed a universe] that is at once surprising, unfamiliar, exciting, elegant, and thoroughly unlike what [anyone ever expected].
            - These developments are anything but details. [Breakthroughs in physics] have forced, and continue to force, [dramatic revisions to] [our conception of the cosmos]. [I remain as convinced now as I did decades ago](((1NclXFUpQ))) 我现在仍然像几十年前一样坚信 that Camus rightly chose [life's value]([[life value]]) as the [[ultimate question]], but [the insights of modern physics] [have persuaded me that] [assessing life] [through the lens of everyday experience](((SNT2aWXhI))) is like [gazing at a van Gogh] [through an empty Coke bottle]. [Modern science] has [spearheaded one assault after another] on 率先发起了一次又一次的攻击 [evidence gathered from] our [rudimentary perceptions], 初步认识 showing that they often [yield a clouded conception] of [the world we inhabit]. 模糊的观念 
                - And so whereas Camus [separated out physical questions] and [labeled them secondary], I've [become convinced that] they're primary. For me, [[physical reality]] both sets the arena and [provides the illumination for] [grappling with Camus' question]. 抓住, 扭打 [Assessing existence] while failing to [embrace the insights of] [[modern physics]] would be like wrestling in the dark [with an unknown opponent]. 与一个未知的对手摔跤 By [deepening our understanding of] [the true nature of physical reality], we profoundly [reconfigure our sense of ourselves] and [our experience of the universe].
(有关于世界的实在和人生的价值-在这里，物理学问题是第一位的而不是次要的)
210402-19:45
            - The [central concern] of this book is to explain some of [the most prominent and pivotal of these revisions] 枢轴 to our [picture of reality], [with an intense focus on] those that affect our species' [long-term project](((6h4yMRsHy))) to [understand space and time]. From Aristotle to Einstein, from the [[astrolabe]] to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], from the pyramids to [mountaintop observatories], space and time have [framed thinking] [since thinking began]. [With the advent of] the [modern scientific age], their importance [has been tremendously heightened]. Over the last three centuries, [developments in physics] have revealed space and time as [the most baffling and most compelling concepts], and as those most instrumental 最重要的工具 in our [scientific analysis] of the universe. Such developments have also shown that space and time [top the list of] age-old [scientific constructs] that are [being fantastically revised by] [[cutting-edge research]].
210402-22:05
- To Isaac Newton, space and time simply were —they formed an inert, universal [cosmic stage] 惰性的 on which [the events of the universe] played themselves out. To his contemporary and frequent rival 竞争对手 [[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]], "space" and "time" were merely [the vocabulary of relations between] where objects were and [when events took place]. Nothing more. But to Albert Einstein, space and time were the [[raw material]] underlying reality. 现实背后的原材料 Through his [theories of relativity], Einstein [jolted our thinking about space and time] and [revealed the principal part] they play in [the evolution of the universe]. Ever since, space and time have been the [sparkling jewels] of physics. They are at once familiar and mystifying; [fully understanding] space and time has become physics' [most daunting challenge] and [sought-after prize].
210402-22:19
    - The developments we'll [cover in this book] [interweave the fabric of] space and time [in various ways]. Some ideas will challenge features of space and time so basic that for centuries, if not millennia, they've [seemed beyond questioning]. Others will [seek the link between] our [theoretical understanding] of space and time and [the traits we commonly experience]. Yet others will [raise questions] unfathomable [within the limited confines of] [ordinary perceptions]. 在普通认知的有限范围内
    - We will speak only minimally of philosophy (and not at all about suicide and [the meaning of life]). But in our [scientific quest] to [solve the mysteries of] space and time, we will be resolutely unrestrained. 坚决不受约束 From the universe's [smallest speck] and [earliest moments] [to its farthest reaches] and [most distant future], we will examine space and time in environments familiar and far-flung, [with an unflinching eye] [seeking their true nature]. As the story of space and time [has yet to be fully written], we won't [arrive at any final assessments]. But we will encounter [a series of developments] — some intensely strange, some deeply satisfying, some experimentally verified, some [thoroughly speculative] —that will show how close we've come to wrapping our minds around the fabric of the cosmos and [touching the true texture of reality].
210403-00:27
- ## Classical Reality
    - Historians differ on exactly when the [modern scientific age] began, but certainly by the time Galileo Galilei, Rene Descartes, and Isaac Newton had had their say, it was briskly under way. In those days, the [new scientific mind-set] [was being steadily forged], 正在稳步形成 as patterns found in [terrestrial and astronomical data] [made it increasingly clear that] there is an order to [all the comings and goings of the cosmos], an order accessible to [careful reasoning] and [mathematical analysis]. These [early pioneers] of [modem scientific thought] argued that, when [looked at the right way], [the happenings in the universe] not only are [explicable](((ksD5xjEdc))) but predictable. 不仅是可解释的 The power of science to foretell aspects of the future —[consistently](((Zzng80XEW))) and quantitatively—had been revealed.
(宇宙的秩序-可解释+可预测)
210403-00:36
        - Early [scientific study] [focused on the kinds of things] [one might see or experience in everyday life]. Galileo [dropped weights] from a [leaning tower](((QlWTb24Yo))) (or so legend has it) and watched balls rolling down [[inclined surface]]s; Newton studied [falling apples](((PZHeWTzQO))) (or so legend has it) and [the orbit of the moon](((FWNeZUhFn))). [The goal of these investigations] was to attune [the nascent scientific ear] 新生的 to [nature's harmonies]. 相协调 To be sure, physical reality was [the stuff of experience], but the challenge was to [hear the rhyme] and [reason behind the rhythm and regularity]. Many sung and unsung heroes contributed to the rapid and [impressive progress] that was made, but Newton [stole the show]. 抢了风头 With a handful of [mathematical equations], he synthesized [everything known about] [motion on earth and in the heavens], and in so doing, [composed the score] for what has come to be known as [[classical physics]]. 
            - In the decades following Newton's work, his equations were developed into [an elaborate mathematical structure] that significantly [extended both their reach and] their [[practical utility]]. Classical physics gradually became a sophisticated and mature [[scientific discipline]]. But shining clearly through all these advances was the beacon of Newton's [original insights]. Even today, more than three hundred years later, you can see [Newton's equations] [scrawled on introductory-physics chalkboards] worldwide, 潦草的笔迹 printed on [NASA flight plans] computing [spacecraft trajectories]([[spacecraft trajectory]]), and embedded within the [complex calculations] of [forefront research].
        - But while [formulating his laws of motion], Newton encountered a critical [stumbling block], one that is of [particular importance] to our story (Chapter 2). Everyone knew that [things could move], but what about the arena [within which the motion took place]? Well, that's space, we'd all answer. But, Newton would reply, what is space? Is space [a real physical entity] or is it [an abstract idea] born of the human struggle to [comprehend the cosmos](((Dl51YOL2m)))? Newton realized that this [key question] had to be answered, because without [taking a stand on] the meaning of space and time, his [equations describing motion] [would prove meaningless]. __Understanding requires context; insight must be anchored. 理解需要语境，洞见必须锚定。__
            - And so, with [a few brief sentences] in his [[Principia Mathematica]], Newton [articulated a conception of] space and time, declaring them [absolute and immutable entities] that [provided the universe with] a rigid, unchangeable arena. According to Newton, space and time supplied [an invisible scaffolding] that [gave the universe shape and structure]. Not everyone agreed. Some [argued persuasively that] [it made little sense to] [ascribe existence to something you can't feel], grasp, or affect. But [the explanatory and predictive power] of [Newton's equations] [quieted the critics]. For the next two hundred years, his [absolute conception of space and time](((9hogHYGsu))) was dogma. 教条

- ## Relativistic Reality
    - The classical [Newtonian worldview](((V10DAbgf_))) was pleasing. Not only did it describe [natural phenomena] [with striking accuracy], but [the details of the description]—the mathematics —aligned tightly with experience. 紧密结合 If you push something, it speeds up. The harder you [throw a ball], the more impact it has when it [smacks into a wall]. If you [press against something], you feel it [pressing back against you]. The more massive something is, the stronger its gravitational pull. These are among the most [basic properties] of the [natural world], and when you learn [Newton's framework], you see them represented in his equations, clear as day. Unlike a [crystal ball](((tdpYT9PQ_)))'s [inscrutable hocus-pocus], 难以捉摸的骗术 the workings of [Newton's laws] were on display for all with minimal [mathematical training] to take in fully. Classical physics [provided a rigorous grounding for] [[human intuition]]. p20
210403-07:10
(经典力学同人类的常识与直觉极其相符)
    - Newton had included [the force of gravity] in his equations, but it was not until the 1860s that the [Scottish scientist] [[James Clerk Maxwell]] [extended the framework of] classical physics to [take account of] [electrical and magnetic forces]. Maxwell needed [additional equations] to do so and [the mathematics he employed] [required a higher level of training to grasp fully]. But his new equations were every bit as successful at explaining [electrical and magnetic phenomena] as Newton's were at [describing motion]. By the late 1800s, it was evident that [the universe's secrets] were proving no match for the power of [[human intellectual]] might.
        - Indeed, with the successful [incorporation of electricity and magnetism], [there was a growing sense that] [[theoretical physics]] [would soon be complete]. Physics, some suggested, was rapidly becoming [a finished subject] and its laws would shortly [be chiseled in stone]. 凿刻在石头上 In 1894, the renowned [[experimental physicist]] [[Albert Michelson]] remarked that "most of the [grand underlying principles] [have been firmly established]" and he quoted an "eminent scientist" —most believe it was the British physicist [[Lord Kelvin]] —as saying that [all that remained] were details of [determining some numbers] to [a greater number of decimal places].[1]() In 1900, Kelvin himself did note that "two clouds" were [hovering on the horizon](((GcGH-LgPD))), one to do with [properties of light's motion] and the other with aspects of [the radiation objects emit] when heated/ but there was [a general feeling that] these were mere details, which, no doubt, would soon be addressed.
210403-07:25
        - Within a decade, everything changed. [As anticipated](((GXq8sRUQJ))), the two problems Kelvin had raised were [promptly addressed], but they proved anything but minor. Each [ignited a revolution], and each required [a fundamental rewriting of] [nature's laws]. The [classical conceptions] of space, time, and reality—the ones that for hundreds of years had not only worked but also [concisely expressed] our [[intuitive sense]] of the world — were overthrown.
210403-07:31
            - The relativity revolution, which addressed the first of Kelvin's "clouds," dates from 1905 and 1915, when Albert Einstein completed his [special and general theories of relativity] (Chapter 3). While [struggling with puzzles] involving electricity, magnetism, and light's motion, Einstein realized that [Newton's conception of space and time], the corner-stone of classical physics, was flawed. [Over the course of] [a few intense weeks] in the spring of 1905, 度过了紧张的几周 he determined that space and time are not [independent and absolute], as Newton had thought, but are enmeshed 陷入网中, 绊住 and relative [in a manner that] [flies in the face of] 完全违背/相冲突 [[common experience]]. 
                - Some ten years later, Einstein [hammered a final nail in] the Newtonian coffin by [rewriting the laws of] [gravitational physics]. This time, not only did Einstein show that space and time are [part of a unified whole], he also showed that by [warping and curving] 翘曲和弯曲 they participate in [[cosmic evolution]]. Far from being the rigid, [unchanging structures] envisioned by Newton, space and time in Einstein's reworking are [flexible and dynamic].
(时空一体，并且是动态的，参与到宇宙演化的过程中)
210403-12:35
                - The two theories of relativity are among humankind's [most precious achievements], and with them Einstein toppled [Newton's conception of reality]. Even though [Newtonian physics] seemed to capture mathematically much of [what we experience physically], [the reality it describes] [turns out not to be] [the reality of our world]. Ours is a [relativistic reality]. Yet, because [the deviation between] classical and relativistic reality [is manifest only under] [[extreme condition]]s 只在极端条件下才显现出来 (such as extremes of speed and gravity'), Newtonian physics still [provides an approximation] that [proves extremely accurate] and useful [in many circumstances]. But utility and reality' are [very different standards]. As we will see, [features of space and time] that for many of us are [[second nature]] 第二天性 have [turned out to be figments] of [a false Newtonian perspective].
(有用和真实是不同的，经典力学远非真实)
210403-12:48
- ## Quantum Reality
    - [The second anomaly] to which Lord Kelvin referred led to the [quantum revolution], [one of the greatest upheavals] 大变动, 剧变 to which [modern human understanding] has ever been subjected. By the time [the fires subsided and the smoke cleared], the veneer of 镶饰 classical physics had been singed off [the newly emerging] framework of quantum reality.
    - A [core feature] of classical physics is that if you know [the positions and velocities of all objects] [at a particular moment], [Newton's equations], together with their [Maxwellian updating], can tell you their positions and velocities [at any other moment], past or future. Without equivocation, 毫无疑义 classical physics declares that [the past and future] are [etched into the present]. 过去和未来蚀刻在当下的全部信息中 This feature is also shared by both special and general relativity'. Although the [relativistic concepts] of past and future are subtler than their familiar [classical counterparts] (Chapters 3 and 5), the equations of relativity, together with [a complete assessment of the present](((oJm6uPeMT))), [determine them just as completely](((Jm21PfeI6))).
210403-13:01
    - By the 1930s, however, physicists were forced to introduce a whole new [[conceptual schema]] called quantum mechanics. Quite unexpectedly, they found that only [quantum laws] were capable of [resolving a host of puzzles] and [explaining a variety of data] [newly acquired from] [the atomic and subatomic realm]. But according to the quantum laws, even if you [make the most perfect measurements] possible of how things are today, [the best you can ever hope to do] is [predict the probability] that [things will be one way or another] [at some chosen time] [in the future], or that things were one way or another at some chosen time [in the past]. The universe, according to quantum mechanics, is not [etched into the present]; the universe, according to quantum mechanics, participates in [a game of chance]. 
        - Although [there is still controversy over] precisely [how these developments should be interpreted], most physicists agree that probability is deeply [woven into the fabric of quantum reality]. Whereas human intuition, and its [embodiment](((xvXO0Yyt3))) in classical physics, envision a reality in which [things are always definitely one way or another], quantum mechanics [describes a reality] in which things sometimes [hover in a haze of] 阴霾中徘徊 [being partly one way and partly another]. [Things become definite only when] [a suitable observation] [forces them to relinquish quantum possibilities] and [settle on a specific outcome]. The outcome that's realized, though, [cannot be predicted](((UlOinNMsd))) —[we can predict only the odds that](((5A0qc5Gr8))) [things will turn out one way or another].
        - This, plainly speaking, is weird. We are unused to a reality' that [remains ambiguous until perceived](((atYFEHIu3))). 觉察; 意识到 But the oddity of quantum mechanics [does not stop here]. At least [as astounding is a feature that] goes back to a paper Einstein wrote in 1935 with two younger colleagues, Nathan Rosen and Boris Podolsky, that was [intended as an attack on] quantum theory.[3] With the [ensuing twists] of [scientific progress], 接踵而来的扭曲 Einstein's paper can now be viewed as among the first to point out that quantum mechanics — if taken at face value —implies that [something you do over here] [can be instantaneously linked to] [something happening over there], regardless of distance. 
            - Einstein considered such [instantaneous connections](((hz1vjVzbt))) ludicrous and [interpreted their emergence from] [the mathematics of quantum theory] as evidence that the theory was [in need of much development] before it would [attain an acceptable form]. But by the 1980s, when [both theoretical and technological developments] [brought experimental scrutiny to] 实验性的检验 bear on these [purported quantum absurdities], 所谓的量子佯谬 [researchers confirmed that] there can be [an instantaneous bond between] [what happens at widely separated locations]. Under pristine laboratory conditions, [what Einstein thought absurd] really happens (Chapter 4).

            - He added that if reports are [taken at face value] 从表面上来看 they showed [extraterrestrial vehicles](((i7j0Y33ud))) 外星人使用的交通工具 [had a very wide range of speeds] and are stealthy. 隐形 www.[i21st].cn
        - [The implications of these features] of quantum mechanics for our [picture of reality] are a subject of [ongoing research]. Many scientists, myself included, [view them as part of] [a radical quantum updating of] the meaning and [properties of space]. Normally, [spatial separation] implies [physical independence](((hAE8Guryc))). If you [want to control what's happening] [on the other side of a football field], you have to go there, or, at the very least, you have to [send someone or something] (the assistant coach, [bouncing air molecules] [conveying speech], [a flash of light] to [get someone's attention], etc.) [across the field] to [convey your influence]. If you don't—if you remain [spatially isolated](((tpJEQ3DRd)))—you will [have no impact], since [intervening space](((pB4Siz-8d))) [ensures the absence of] a [physical connection]. 
            - Quantum mechanics [challenges this view] by revealing, at least [in certain circumstances], a capacity to transcend space; [long-range quantum connections](((f0wowQqc-))) can [bypass spatial separation]. Two objects can be [far apart in space], but as far as quantum mechanics is concerned, it's as if they're a [single entity](((jCeru4_Hj))). Moreover, because of [the tight link between] space and time found by Einstein, the [quantum connections] also have [temporal tentacles]. 时间上的约束 We'll shortly encounter some clever and [truly wondrous experiments] that have recently explored a number of the startling 惊人的 [spatiotemporal interconnections](((M45eYuXGe))) entailed by quantum mechanics and, as we'll see, they 强有力地 forcefully challenge the classical, [intuitive worldview] [many of us hold].
(经典物理学中，空间上的分离意味着彼此间的独立性，任何相关性都需要物理实体之间的空间上的接触来传递)
210403-20:12
    - Despite these many [impressive insights], there remains one very [basic feature] of time —that it seems to [have a direction](((vGNe1jKat))) [pointing from past to future] —for which neither relativity nor quantum mechanics has [provided an explanation]. Instead, the only [convincing progress] has come from [research in an area of physics] called [[cosmology]].
210403-20:18
- ## Cosmological Reality
    - To [open our eyes to] [the true nature of the universe] has always been one of physics' [primary purposes]. It's hard to imagine a more [mind-stretching experience] than learning, as we have over the last century, that [the reality we experience] is but [a glimmer of the reality] that is. But physics also [has the equally important charge of] explaining [the elements of reality] that [we actually do experience]. From our [rapid march] [through the history of physics], [it might seem as if] this [has already been achieved], as if [ordinary experience](((SNT2aWXhI))) is addressed by pre-twentieth-century [advances in physics]. To some extent, this is true. But even [when it comes to the everyday], we are far from [a full understanding]. And among the features of [common experience] that have [resisted complete explanation] is one that taps into one of the deepest [unresolved mysteries] in [modern physics] —the mystery that the great British physicist [[Sir Arthur Eddington]] called [the arrow of time]([[time arrow]])* 
        - We [take for granted that] [there is a direction to] [the way things unfold in time](((BA2DeyXZd))). Eggs break, but they don't unbreak; candles melt, but they don't unmelt; [memories are of the past](((-zyh_aRYy))), never of the future; people age, but they don't unage. These [asymmetries]([[asymmetry]]) [govern our lives]; [the distinction between forward and backward in time] is a [prevailing element] of [experiential reality]. If [forward and backward in time] [exhibited the same symmetry] we witness [between left and right], or back and forth, the world would be unrecognizable. 不可识别 Eggs would unbreak as often as they broke; candles would unmelt as often as they melted; we'd remember as much [about the future] as we do about the past; people would unage as often as they aged. Certainly, such a [time-symmetric reality](((SRj0d5yvn))) is [not our reality]. But where does [time's asymmetry](((lnYqTIHNW))) come from? [What is responsible for] this most basic of all [time's properties]?
210403-23:31
        - [It turns out that] [the known and accepted laws of physics] [show no such asymmetry] (Chapter 6): each direction in time, forward and backward, is [treated by the laws without distinction]. __And that's the origin of [a huge puzzle].__ Nothing in the equations of [fundamental physics] [shows any sign of] [treating one direction in time] differently from the other, and that is [totally at odds with] [everything we experience].[5] 相悖
        - Surprisingly, even though we are focusing on [a familiar feature] of [[everyday life]], [the most convincing resolution] of this mismatch between fundamental physics and [basic experience] requires us to contemplate 冥思苦想 [the most unfamiliar of events] —[the beginning of the universe](((7Lk5n7BaV))). This realization [has its roots in the work of] the great nineteenth-century physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], and in the years since [has been elaborated on by](((Q1IHuOoGz))) many researchers, most notably the __[British mathematician]__ [[Roger Penrose]]. As we will see, [special physical conditions] [at the universe's inception] 起始 ([a highly ordered environment](((9EQsjsSup))) at or just after the [[big bang]]) may have [imprinted a direction on time], rather as [winding up a clock], 收紧钟表 [twisting its spring into] 扭动/拧转弹簧 a [[highly ordered]] [[initial state]], allows it to tick forward. Thus, in a sense we'll make precise, the breaking—as opposed to the unbreaking— of an egg [bears witness to conditions] 见证了 [at the birth of the universe] [some 14 billion years ago].
(时间的方向性起源于一个高度有序的宇宙初始状态)
210403-23:47
            - This unexpected link between everyday experience and the [early universe] [provides insight into] why [events unfold one way in time] and [never the reverse], but it does not [fully solve the mystery of] time's arrow. Instead, it [shifts the puzzle to] [the realm of cosmology]—the study of [the origin and evolution of the entire cosmos] —and [compels us to find out] whether the universe actually had [the highly ordered beginning] that this explanation of time's arrow requires.
    - Cosmology is [among the oldest subjects to] [captivate our species]. 迷住 And it's no wonder. We're [[storyteller]]s, and what story could be more grand than [the story of creation](((WoRadSfqz)))? Over the last few millennia, [religious and philosophical traditions] worldwide [have weighed in with] [a wealth of versions of] how everything—the universe — got started. Science, too, over its long history, has [tried its hand at] cosmology. But it was [Einstein's discovery] of [[general relativity]] that [marked the birth of] [modern scientific cosmology].
210404-00:47
        - Shortly after Einstein published his [theory of general relativity], both he and others [applied it to the universe as a whole]. Within a few decades, their research led to the [tentative framework] 试验性 for what is now called the [[big bang theory]], an approach that [successfully explained] many features of [[astronomical observation]]s (Chapter 8). In the mid-1960s, [evidence in support of] big bang cosmology [mounted further], as observations revealed [a nearly uniform haze of] [[microwave radiation]] [permeating space](((Vaxpbt_ay))) —[invisible to the naked eye] but [readily measured by] [microwave detectors] —that was [predicted by the theory]. And certainly by the 1970s, [after a decade of] [closer scrutiny] and [substantial progress](((vNnvQpH3c))) in determining how [basic ingredients] [in the cosmos] [respond to extreme changes] in heat and temperature, the big bang theory [secured its place as] [the leading cosmological theory] (Chapter 9).

            - Its successes notwithstanding, 尽管它看上去成功了 the theory [suffered significant shortcomings]. [It had trouble explaining] why space has the [overall shape] [revealed by detailed astronomical observations], and it [offered no explanation for] why [the temperature of the microwave radiation], [intently studied] [ever since its discovery], [appears thoroughly uniform](((gOcJOzb7U))) [across the sky]. Moreover, what is of [primary concern] to the story we're telling, the big bang theory [provided no compelling reason] why the universe might have been [highly ordered] [near the very beginning], [as required by the explanation for] [time's arrow].
210404-04:03
            - These and other [[open issue]]s [inspired a major breakthrough] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, known as [[inflationary cosmology]] (Chapter 10). Inflationary cosmology [modifies the big bang theory] by inserting [an extremely brief burst] of [astoundingly rapid expansion] [during the universe's earliest moments] (in this approach, [the size of the universe](((PDnLaAYMp))) [increased by a factor] larger than [a million trillion trillion] in less than a millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second). As will become clear, this [stupendous growth] of [the young universe] [goes a long way toward] [filling in the gaps left by] [the big bang model] —of explaining [the shape of space](((KdivQCjdg))) and [the uniformity of the microwave radiation], and also of suggesting why [the early universe] might have been highly ordered—thus [providing significant progress toward] explaining both astronomical observations and [the arrow of time] we all experience (Chapter 11).
210404-05:15
                - Yet, despite these mounting successes, 尽管取得了巨大的成功 [for two decades] inflationary cosmology has been harboring its own [embarrassing secret]. Like the [standard big bang theory] it modified, inflationary cosmology [rests on the equations] Einstein discovered with his [general theory of relativity]. Although volumes of [research articles] [attest to the power of] Einstein's equations to [accurately describe] [large and massive objects], physicists have long known that an accurate [theoretical analysis] of [small objects]—such as the [[observable universe]] when it was [a mere fraction of] a second old — requires the use of [[quantum mechanics]]. The problem, though, is that when the equations of [general relativity] commingle with those of quantum mechanics, the result is disastrous. The equations [break down entirely], and this [prevents us from] determining [how the universe was born] and whether [at its birth] it [realized the conditions necessary to] [explain time's arrow].
210404-05:20
                - [It's not an overstatement to] [describe this situation as] [a theoretician's nightmare]: the absence of [[mathematical tool]]s with which to [analyze a vital realm] that lies beyond [[experimental accessibility]]. 实验可及性 And since space and time are so [thoroughly entwined with] this [particular inaccessible realm] —[the origin of the universe](((7Lk5n7BaV))) — understanding space and time fully requires us to find equations that can cope with 应付, 处理 the [[extreme condition]]s of huge density, energy, and [temperature characteristic] of [the universe's earliest moments]. This is an absolutely essential goal, and one that many physicists believe requires developing a so-called [[unified theory]].

- ## Unified Reality
    - Over the past few centuries, physicists have sought to [consolidate our understanding of] the [natural world] by showing that [diverse and apparently distinct phenomena] are actually [governed by a single set of physical laws]. To Einstein, [this goal of unification] —of [explaining the widest array of phenomena] [with the fewest physical principles] —became a [lifelong passion]. With his [two theories of relativity], Einstein united space, time, and gravity. But this success only [encouraged him to think bigger]. He dreamed of finding a single, [all-encompassing framework] capable of [embracing all of nature's laws]; he called that framework a unified theory. Although now and then [rumors spread that] Einstein had [found a unified theory], all such claims [turned out to be baseless]; Einstein's dream went unfulfilled. p29
210404-05:47
        - Einstein's focus on a unified theory during the last thirty years of his life [distanced him from] [mainstream physics]. Many [younger scientists] viewed his [single-minded search for] [the grandest of all theories] as the ravings of [a great man] who, in his later years, had [turned down the wrong path]. But in the decades since Einstein's passing, [a growing number of] physicists have [taken up his unfinished quest]. Today, developing a unified theory [ranks among the most important problems] in theoretical physics. For many years, physicists found that the [central obstacle] to [realizing a unified theory] was the [fundamental conflict between] [the two major breakthroughs] of twentieth-century physics: general relativity and quantum mechanics. Although these two frameworks are typically [applied in vastly different realms] —general relativity to [big things] like [stars and galaxies], quantum mechanics to [small things] like [molecules and atoms] —each theory [claims to be universal](((skGH9NSUg))), to [work in all realms]. 
            - However, as mentioned above, whenever the theories are [used in conjunction], their [combined equations] [produce nonsensical answers]. For instance, when quantum mechanics is used with general relativity to [calculate the probability] that some process or other [involving gravity] will take place, [the answer that's often found] is not something like a probability of 24 percent or 63 percent or 91 percent; instead, out of the [combined mathematics] pops an [infinite probability]. That doesn't mean [a probability so high] that you should [put all your money on it] because it's a shoo-in. 十拿九稳 [Probabilities bigger than 100 percent] are meaningless. Calculations that [produce an infinite probability] simply show that the combined equations of general relativity and quantum mechanics [have gone haywire].

            - Scientists [have been aware of] the tension between general relativity and quantum mechanics [for more than half a century], but [for a long time] relatively 相当程度上 few [felt compelled to search for a resolution]. 有必要寻求解决方案 Instead, most researchers used general relativity solely for analyzing [large and massive objects], while reserving quantum mechanics solely for analyzing [small and light objects], carefully keeping each theory [a safe distance from the other] so their [mutual hostility] [would be held in check]. Over the years, [this approach to detente] 缓和 has allowed for [stunning advances in] [our understanding of each domain], but it does not [yield a lasting peace].
210404-06:30
                - A very few realms —extreme [physical situations] that are [both massive and tiny]—[fall squarely in] the [demilitarized zone], 非武装地带 requiring that general relativity and quantum mechanics [simultaneously be brought to bear]. [The center of a black hole](((wAkWVlqcF))), in which [an entire star] [has been crushed by its own weight] to [a minuscule point], and the big bang, in which [the entire observable universe] is imagined to have been [compressed to a nugget] 熔核 [far smaller than a single atom], provide the two [most familiar examples]. Without [a successful union between] general relativity and quantum mechanics, [the end of collapsing stars](((RoEWXHs6q))) and [the origin of the universe] [would remain forever mysterious]. Many scientists were willing to [set aside these realms], or at least [defer thinking about them] until other, [more tractable problems](((jyv_5zshY))) had been overcome.
210404-06:38
                - But a few researchers couldn't wait. [A conflict in the known laws of physics] means a failure to [grasp a deep truth] and that was enough to keep these scientists from [resting easy]. Those who plunged in, though, [found the waters deep] and [the currents rough]. 水流湍急 For long stretches of time, research [made little progress]; things looked bleak. Even so, the tenacity of 坚韧不拔 those who [had the determination to stay the course] 坚持到底 and [keep alive the dream of] uniting general relativity and quantum mechanics is being rewarded. Scientists are now [charging down paths blazed by those explorers] 开辟的道路 and are closing in on [a harmonious merger of] [the laws of the large and small]. The approach that many agree is [a leading contender] is [[superstring theory]] (Chapter 12).
210404-06:46
                - As we will see, superstring theory starts off by proposing a new answer to an old question: what are the smallest, indivisible constituents of matter? For many decades, the conventional answer has been that matter is composed of particles —electrons and quarks—that can be modeled as dots that are indivisible and that have no size and no internal structure. Conventional theory claims, and experiments confirm, that these particles combine in various ways to produce protons, neutrons, and the wide variety of atoms and molecules making up everything we've ever encountered. Superstring theory tells a different story. It does not deny the key role played by electrons, quarks, and the other particle species revealed by experiment, but it does claim that these particles are not dots. Instead, according to superstring theory, ever}' particle is composed of a tiny filament of energy, some hundred billion billion times smaller than a single atomic nucleus (much smaller than we can currently probe), which is shaped like a little string. And just as a violin string can vibrate in different patterns, each of which produces a different musical tone, the filaments of superstring theory can also vibrate in different patterns. But these vibrations don't produce different musical notes; remarkably, the theory claims that they produce different particle properties. A tiny string vibrating in one pattern would have the mass and the electric charge of an electron; according to the theory, such a vibrating string would be what we have traditionally called an electron. A tiny string vibrating in a different pattern would have the requisite properties to identify it as a quark, a neutrino, or any other kind of particle. All species of particles are unified in superstring theory since each arises from a different vibrational pattern executed by the same underlying entity.

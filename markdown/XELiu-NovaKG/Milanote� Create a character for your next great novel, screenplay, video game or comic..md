- ### Start with a character archetype
    - [Character archetypes]([[character archetype]]) are [universal personas](((lLFL53Vy_))) that we [subconsciously recognise] 潜意识中认识到的 [when we see them]. They [recur across literature and mythology] and their [actions and behaviours] are [laden with meaning and associations]. 充满了意义和联想 A great example is the Orphan—Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker and Simba from the [Lion King] are all underpinned by this same [prototype character]. [It's also common to find] both layered archetypes (e.g. Sméagol from [The Lord of The Rings] - a combination of the Trickster & Shadow) and even characters that [transform from one into another over time]. The evolution of [Sarah Connor] in Terminator, from Waif to Crusader, is a great example here ([Read more](https://btleditorial.com/2016/12/05/common-archetypal-character/) about character archetypes for your story).
    - Start by [adding your plot outline to] an empty **Board**.
    - Decide which [character archetypes] are evoked.
    - [Map out the roles] that your character archetypes play by connecting **Boards **with **Lines**.
(原型人物所需要扮演的角色)
    - Add in **Notes** to explain the [major plot points].
    - Don't forget, you can make **Notes** transparent to [keep things tidy].
- ### Add specific characteristics
    -  Once you've [defined an initial archetype], you can begin to [shape the character] and make them original. You should consider [the emotional connection between] your audience and your character, and [work towards the desired outcome]. You may find that [switching the age and gender of a character] can [lead to very different responses] from an [[audience]].

        - [Brainstorm your character's core traits]([[brainstorm]]) using **Notes** and **Lines **inside a **Board**.
        - Try to [extend your character's traits into](((VdLkrRZyR))) [behaviours and actions]. If a character is brave, what could their [[hobby]] be?

- In quantum mechanics, identical particles (also called indistinguishable or indiscernible particles) 不可识别 are particles that cannot be [distinguished from one another], even in principle. Species of identical particles include, but are not limited to, [[elementary particle]]s (such as electrons), composite [[subatomic particle]]s (such as [[atomic nuclei]]), as well as atoms and molecules. [[quasiparticle]]s [also behave in this way]. Although [all known indistinguishable particles] only exist at the [[quantum scale]], [there is no exhaustive list of] [all possible sorts of] particles nor [a clear-cut limit of applicability](((7FoQpbZ6I))), 明确限制 as explored in [[quantum statistics]].

    - [There are two main categories of] identical particles: [[boson]]s, which can share [[quantum state]]s, and [[fermion]]s, which cannot (as described by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). Examples of bosons are photons, gluons, phonons, [[helium-4 nuclei]] and all [[meson]]s. Examples of fermions are electrons, neutrinos, quarks, protons, neutrons, and helium-3 nuclei.
    - [The fact that] [particles can be identical] [has important consequences in] [[statistical mechanics]], where calculations rely on [[probabilistic argument]]s, which are [[sensitive]] to whether or not [the objects being studied] are identical. As a result, identical particles exhibit [markedly different] [[statistical behaviour]] from [distinguishable particles]. For example, [the indistinguishability of particles] [has been proposed as a solution to] [[Gibbs' mixing paradox]].

- Distinguishing between particles
    - [There are two methods for] [distinguishing between particles]. The first method [relies on differences in] the [intrinsic physical properties]([[intrinsic property]]) of the particles, such as mass, electric charge, and spin. If differences exist, [it is possible to distinguish between] the particles by [measuring the relevant properties]. However, [it is an empirical fact that] [microscopic particles] of the [same species] [have completely equivalent physical properties]. For instance, [every electron in the universe] [has exactly the same electric charge]; this is why [it is possible to speak of such a thing as] "the charge of the electron".

    - Even if the particles have equivalent physical properties, [there remains a second method for] distinguishing between particles, which is to [track the trajectory of](((b00x-cUhS))) each particle. As long as the position of each particle can be measured [with infinite precision](((QDTGANrfP))) (even when the particles collide), then [there would be no ambiguity about] [which particle is which].
    - [The problem with the second approach] is that it [contradicts the principles of] quantum mechanics. According to quantum theory, the particles [do not possess definite positions]([[definite position]]) [during the periods between measurements]. Instead, they are governed by [[wavefunction]]s that [give the probability of] [finding a particle at each position]. As time passes, the wavefunctions [tend to spread out and overlap]. Once this happens, it becomes impossible to determine, in a subsequent measurement, which of [the particle positions] [correspond to those measured earlier]. [The particles are then said to be] indistinguishable.

- ## Quantum mechanical description
    - ### Symmetrical and antisymmetrical states
        - [What follows is an example to] [make the above discussion concrete], [using the formalism developed in] the article on the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]].
        - Let n denote a [[complete set]] of (discrete) [[quantum number]]s for [specifying single-particle states] (for example, for the [[particle in a box]] problem, take n to be the [[quantized wave vector]] of the wavefunction.) For simplicity, [consider a system composed of] two particles that are [not interacting with each other]. [Suppose that] one particle is in the state n1, and the other is in the state n2. 
            - Intuitively, [the quantum state of the system]([[quantum state]]) is written as $${\displaystyle |n_{1}\rangle |n_{2}\rangle }$$ where [the state writing order] matters such as [the firstly written state] is for the particle 1 and the secondly written state is for the particle 2 (so, if $${\displaystyle |n_{2}\rangle |n_{1}\rangle }$$, then the particle 1 [occupies the state] n2 while the particle 2 occupies the state n1). This is simply the canonical way of constructing a basis for a tensor product space $$H\otimes H$$ of the [combined system] [from the individual spaces]. This expression is valid for distinguishable particles, however, it is not appropriate for indistinguishable particles since {\displaystyle |n_{1}\rangle |n_{2}\rangle }{\displaystyle |n_{1}\rangle |n_{2}\rangle } and {\displaystyle |n_{2}\rangle |n_{1}\rangle }{\displaystyle |n_{2}\rangle |n_{1}\rangle } as a result of exchanging the particles are generally different states.

"the particle 1 occupies the n1 state and the particle 2 occupies the n2 state" ≠ "the particle 1 occupies the n2 state and the particle 2 occupies the n1 state".

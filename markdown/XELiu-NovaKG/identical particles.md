- In quantum mechanics, identical particles (also called indistinguishable or indiscernible particles) 不可识别 are particles that cannot be [distinguished from one another], even in principle. Species of identical particles include, but are not limited to, [[elementary particle]]s (such as electrons), composite [[subatomic particle]]s (such as [[atomic nuclei]]), as well as atoms and molecules. [[quasiparticle]]s [also behave in this way]. Although [all known indistinguishable particles] only exist at the [[quantum scale]], [there is no exhaustive list of] [all possible sorts of] particles nor [a clear-cut limit of applicability](((7FoQpbZ6I))), 明确限制 as explored in [[quantum statistics]].

    - [There are two main categories of] identical particles: [[boson]]s, which can share [[quantum state]]s, and [[fermion]]s, which cannot (as described by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). Examples of bosons are photons, gluons, phonons, [[helium-4 nuclei]] and all [[meson]]s. Examples of fermions are electrons, neutrinos, quarks, protons, neutrons, and helium-3 nuclei.
    - [The fact that] [particles can be identical] [has important consequences in] [[statistical mechanics]], where calculations rely on [[probabilistic argument]]s, which are [[sensitive]] to whether or not [the objects being studied] are identical. As a result, identical particles exhibit [markedly different] [[statistical behaviour]] from [distinguishable particles]. For example, the indistinguishability of particles has been proposed as a solution to Gibbs' mixing paradox.

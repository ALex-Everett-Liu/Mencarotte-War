- A photoionization detector or PID is a type of [[gas detector]].
    - Typical photoionization detectors measure [[volatile organic compounds (VOCs)]] and [other gases] in [[concentration]]s from sub [parts per billion]([[parts per billion (ppb)]]) to 10 000 [[parts per million (ppm)]]. The photoionization detector is an efficient and inexpensive detector for many [[gas analyte]] and [[vapor analyte]]s. PIDs [produce instantaneous readings](((H-yb4SU5Q))), [operate continuously](((bnC2WCf0h))), and are [commonly used as] detectors for [[gas chromatography]] or as [hand-held portable instruments](((RVT-MB2ge))). Hand-held, battery-operated versions are widely used in military, industrial, and confined working facilities for health and safety. Their primary use is for monitoring possible worker exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as solvents, fuels, degreasers, plastics & their precursors, heat transfer fluids, lubricants, etc. during manufacturing processes and waste handling.
    - Portable PIDs are used for monitoring:
        - Industrial hygiene and safety
Environmental contamination and remediation
Hazardous materials handling
Ammonia detection
Lower explosive limit measurements
Arson investigation
Indoor air quality
Cleanroom facility maintenance

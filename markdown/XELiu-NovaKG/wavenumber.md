- In the [physical sciences], the wavenumber (also [[wave number]] or repetency[1]) is the [[spatial frequency]] of a wave, measured in [cycles per unit distance] 周期 or [radians per unit distance]. 弧度 Whereas [[temporal frequency]] [can be thought of] as the number of waves [[per unit time]], wavenumber is the number of waves [[per unit distance]].

    - In [[multidimensional system]]s, the wavenumber is the [[magnitude]] of the [[wave vector]]. The space of wave vectors is called [[reciprocal space]]. Wave numbers and wave vectors [play an essential role in] optics and the physics of [[wave scattering]], such as X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, electron diffraction, and [elementary particle physics]. For [quantum mechanical waves], the wavenumber multiplied by the [[reduced Planck's constant]] is the [[canonical momentum]].
    - Wavenumber can be used to specify quantities other than spatial frequency. In optical spectroscopy, [it is often used as] a unit of [[temporal frequency]] [assuming a certain speed of light](((b9uW7Qkyi))).

        - This diagram [describes the relationships between] the various properties of harmonic waves: frequency, period, wavelength, angular frequency, and wavenumber.

        - The properties are organized in three axes:
            - linear properties on the left, and their [angular equivalents] on the right;
            - frequency properties on the top, and their periodic reciprocals on the bottom;
            - temporal properties at the front, and their spatial equivalents at the back.

It makes use of the [xymatrix package](http://www.jmilne.org/not/Mxymatrix.pdf), and uses a [command definition](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/96479) from TeX.StackExchange do draw the [barred lambda] character.
            - To generate the [[SVG]] image, the LaTeX document was exported from ShareLaTeX [as a PDF file], converted to SVG using [Online-Convert.com](http://www.online-convert.com/), and cleaned-up (grouping related objects, tweaking positioning of some elements) using [Inkscape](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inkscape).

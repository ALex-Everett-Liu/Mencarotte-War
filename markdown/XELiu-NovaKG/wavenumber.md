- [波数]([[wavenumber]]) $$\sigma=10000 / \lambda \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$ (lambda[μm]*n[cm^-1]=10000)

- In the [physical sciences], the wavenumber (also [[wave number]] or repetency[1]) is the [[spatial frequency]] of a wave, measured in [cycles per unit distance] 周期 or [radians per unit distance]. 弧度 Whereas [[temporal frequency]] [can be thought of] as the number of waves [[per unit time]], wavenumber is the number of waves [[per unit distance]].

    - In [[multidimensional system]]s, the wavenumber is the [[magnitude]] of the [[wave vector]]. The space of wave vectors is called [[reciprocal space]]. Wave numbers and wave vectors [play an essential role in] optics and the physics of [[wave scattering]], such as X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, electron diffraction, and [elementary particle physics]. For [quantum mechanical waves], the wavenumber multiplied by the [[reduced Planck's constant]] is the [[canonical momentum]].
    - Wavenumber can be used to specify quantities other than spatial frequency. In optical spectroscopy, it is often used as a unit of temporal frequency assuming a certain speed of light.

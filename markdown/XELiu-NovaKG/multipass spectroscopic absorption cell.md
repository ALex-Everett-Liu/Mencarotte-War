- [Multiple-pass or long path absorption cells] are commonly used in spectroscopy to [measure low-concentration components] or to [observe weak spectra in gases or liquids]. Several important advances were made in this area beginning in the 1930s, and [research into a wide range of applications] [continues to the present day].

- Functional Overview
    - Generally the goal of this type of [[sample cell]] is to improve detection sensitivity by [increasing the total optical path length]([[optical path length (OPL)]]) that travels through a small, constant [[sample volume]]. In principle, a longer path length results in greater [[detection sensitivity]]. [[focusing mirror]]s must be used to [redirect the beam at each reflection point]([[reflection point]]), resulting in the beam being [restricted to a predefined space] [along a controlled path] [until it exits the optical cavity]([[optical cavity]]). 
        - [The output of the cell] is the input of an [[optical detector]] (a specialized type of [[transducer]]), which [senses specific changes in the properties of the beam] that occur [during interaction with the test sample]([[test sample]]). For instance, the sample may [absorb energy from the beam], resulting in [an attenuation of the output] that is [detectable by the transducer]. [Two conventional multipass cells] are the [[White cell]] and [[Herriott cell]].[1]

- While the [individual use case]([[use case]]) for Roam stands on its own [[merit]]s, the [ultimate goal] is to [create a platform for] [[collaborative research]] and [[collaborative learning]]. [Current protocols]([[protocol]]) are [bound by the assumption of] [[necessary consensus]]. The [[flexibility]] of a [curated knowledge graph](((a9w_NtMtW))) allows for a more [pluralistic approach], 多元化的 ^^with the ability to [weight conflicting opinions] and [[separate signal from noise]] [without resorting to](((1DK4hJp4X))) either [[autocracy]] or [[democracy]]. ^^ 能够在不诉诸专制或民主的相应手段的情况下，权衡相互冲突的观点，将信号与噪音分离。

- 8.1	[[Finding signal in the noise]] 在噪声中寻觅信号/分离信号与噪音
- 8.2	**Redundancy** 信息的冗余
    - Navigating [a vast sea of information] [creates massive redundancy]([[redundancy]]). Most people [labour away at problems](((CQopHQIc4))) that [have already been solved] ^^[a million times over]. ^^ Those who [tackle unsolved problems] often do so in silos, unaware of each other’s existence. [All the pieces of] any given [[puzzle]] may be present, but no one [individual or group] [holds them all]. 所有解决这个问题的拼图的碎片全都在这里了，散落在公共空间中，但是，我们每个人手中拿到的都只是部分的碎片。
^^[The wheel is reinvented]([[reinvent the wheel]]) [over and over again], 重复造轮子 in endless [[forum]]s and [[comment section]]s and [[web page]]s and books that [burst into existence] and [fade just as quickly to obscurity](((aUtXo6ZrS))). 有价值的信息突然出现在无名的角落，又很快被众人遗忘，消失得无影无踪。^^

        - silos: 地下贮藏库
    - The goal of Roam is to [enable systematic curation and collaboration] [on a large scale]. Users [will be able to] [selectively share parts of their graphs] (selective sharing) publicly, or with [circles of peers] and [[colleague]]s. In turn, they [will be able to] [[follow the work]] [of persons they trust], whether they be [[domain expert]]s or [[enthusiastic amateur]]s. Those [looking to acquire] [[specific knowledge]] can turn immediately to [[trusted source]]s, and [[set alert]]s to [[receive update]]s about [new pieces of information]([[information piece]]) [pertaining to](((iMT4oK_dL))) [[an area of interest]].

- 8.3	**Dispensing with necessary consensus** 在必要的共识的基础上去进行知识的[分发](((rm7kPRTsX)))
    - Almost every [[medium]] today [presents knowledge] as though it were the [last word]; assuming both a [[necessary consensus]] and an [uncomposable page](((MmDdHQ2Ml))). 
[[Wikipedia]] is one of the [great wonders]([[wonder]]) of the [[Internet Age]], but it [makes both of these mistakes]. There can only be [one article on any subject]([[subject]]) [for any given language], and [the only connection between pages](((6UCYtK1ZB))) is [through links]([[link pages]]), with [no article "built" off another](((a4zd_Qh-C))). 
页面之间的唯一连接是通过链接，并且没有文章是在另一篇文章的基础上构建的。
201126-22:36
    - By way of contrast, consider [[Github]]: [Libraries]([[library]]) are [built on other libraries], and [[function]]s are built from other functions. [Developers]([[developer]]) [build tools](((a4zd_Qh-C))) that [others can build upon] to [build ever more impressive tools]. Most of the [modern web] is built on [open-source technologies]([[open-source technology]]), which would not have been possible if [[programmer]]s followed the [old protocols]([[protocol]]) for [[intellectual collaboration]].
201126-23:57
    - [Many problems can be solved]([[problem-solving]]) by [[writing code]], but [[natural language]] is [still the way we determine] [which problems are worth solving](((mnqBFw9mp))). Natural language is how we [explain the world to one another], and communicate our [models of reality]([[reality model]]). It is the language of [[education]]. It is the language of [[decision-making]]. That language needs a [[toolchain]] for collaboration that is just [as good as the one for] [managing code]([[code management]]). 
201127-00:46; 210614-01:00
        - 所以 Roam Research 的理念是将 wiki 改造的像 github 一样，像管理代码这种抽象计算机语言一样去管理自然语言。牛逼！！！
        - 一个供我学习研究的页面如果不能供我自由更改、自由分配与组合，那显然这不是足够自由的学习研究。
- 8.4	[[Against autocracy; against democracy]] 反对专制，同样反对民主（追寻更智慧的群体决策）

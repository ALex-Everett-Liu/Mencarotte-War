- While the [individual use case]([[use case]]) for Roam stands on its own [[merit]]s, the [[ultimate goal]] is to [create a platform for]([[platform]]) [[collaborative research]] and [[collaborative learning]]. [Current protocols]([[protocol]]) are [bound by the assumption of] [[necessary consensus]]. The [[flexibility]] of a [curated knowledge graph](((a9w_NtMtW))) allows for a more [pluralistic approach], 多元化的 ^^with the ability to [weight conflicting opinions](((BsqBfyuhF))) and [[separate signal from noise]] [without resorting to](((1DK4hJp4X))) either [[autocracy]] or [[democracy]]. ^^ 能够在不诉诸专制或民主的相应手段的情况下，权衡相互冲突的观点，将信号与噪音分离。

- 8.1	[[Finding signal in the noise]] 在噪声中寻觅信号/分离信号与噪音
- 8.2	**Redundancy** 信息的冗余
    - Navigating [a vast sea of information] [creates massive redundancy]([[redundancy]]). Most people [labour away at problems](((CQopHQIc4))) that [have already been solved](((fZwhy2kQ-))) ^^[a million times over]. ^^ Those who [tackle unsolved problems](((fZwhy2kQ-))) often do so in silos, unaware of each other’s existence. [All the pieces of] any given [[puzzle]] may be present, but no one [individual or group] [holds them all]. 所有解决这个问题的拼图的碎片全都在这里了，散落在公共空间中，但是，我们每个人手中拿到的都只是部分的碎片。
^^[The wheel is reinvented]([[reinvent the wheel]]) [over and over again], 重复造轮子 in endless [[forum]]s and [[comment section]]s and [[web page]]s and books that [burst into existence] and [fade just as quickly to obscurity]. 有价值的信息突然出现在无名的角落，又很快被众人遗忘，消失得无影无踪。^^

        - silos: 地下贮藏库
        - obscurity: 默默无闻; 无名; 费解; 晦涩; 难懂的事; 昏暗; 黑暗
    - The goal of Roam is to enable [[systematic curation]] and collaboration on a [[large scale]]. Users [will be able to] [selectively share parts of their graphs]([[selective sharing]]) publicly, or with [circles of peers] and [[colleague]]s. In turn, they [will be able to] [follow the work](((srgI50K-v))) [of persons they trust], whether they be [[domain expert]]s or [[enthusiastic amateur]]s. Those [looking to acquire] [[specific knowledge]] can turn immediately to [[trusted source]]s, and [[set alert]]s to [[receive update]]s about [new pieces of information]([[information piece]]) [pertaining to](((iMT4oK_dL))) an [[area of interest]].

- 8.3	**Dispensing with necessary consensus** 在必要的共识的基础上去进行知识的[分发](((rm7kPRTsX)))
    - Almost every [[medium]] today [presents knowledge] as though it were the [last word]; assuming both a [[necessary consensus]] and an [uncomposable page](). 
[[Wikipedia]] is one of the [great wonders]([[wonder]]) of the [[Internet Age]], but it [makes both of these mistakes]. There can only be [one article on any subject]([[subject]]) [for any given language], and [the only connection between pages]() is [through links]([[link pages]]), with [no article "built" off another]([[article built on blocks]]). 
页面之间的唯一连接是通过链接，并且没有文章是在另一篇文章的基础上构建的。

        - composable: 可组合, 可配置
    - By way of contrast, consider [[Github]]: [Libraries]([[library]]) are [built on other libraries], and [[function]]s are built from other functions. [Developers]([[developer]]) [build tools]() that [others can build upon] to [build ever more impressive tools]. Most of the [modern web] is built on [open-source technologies]([[open-source technology]]), which would not have been possible if [[programmer]]s followed the [old protocols]([[protocol]]) for [[intellectual collaboration]].

- A VISIT TO ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES IN THE worlds of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS­ -- [[Waterdeep]], [[the Free City of Greyhawk]], or even uncanny [[Sigil, the City of Doors]]­ [overwhelms the senses]. Voices chatter in [countless different languages]. [The smells of cooking] [in dozens of different cuisines]([[cuisine]]) mingle with the odors of [crowded streets] and [poor sanitation]. 糟糕的卫生条件 Buildings in myriad [[architectural style]]s [display the diverse origins of their inhabitants].

    - Lavish and exotic, the Maserati overwhelms the senses 压倒感官 in the way you remember Claudia Cardinale or Gina Lollobrigida. www.[fortunechina].com
    - And the people themselves-people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in [a dazzling spectrum of styles] and 色调 hues-represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves 矮胖的 to majestically beautiful elves, [mingling among a variety of] [human ethnicities](((SJcZCVVMh))). 混杂在
    - Scattered among the members of these [more common races] are the [true exotics](((NSVnvvseA))): a hulking [[dragonborn]] here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly [[tiefling]] there, [lurking in the shadows] [with mischief in her eyes]. 恶作剧 ; 顽皮 ; 恶意 ; 使坏的念头 A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever [wooden toy] that [moves of its own accord]. 能自动移动的 Half­ elves and [half-ores](((P2XlwdkGM))) live and [work alongside humans], without fully belonging to the races of either of their parents. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone draw-a fugitive 逃亡者 from the [subterranean expanse] of the [[Underdark]], trying to [make his way in] a world that [fears his kind].

- ## CHOOSING A RACE
    - Humans are [the most common people] in the worlds of D&D, but they [live and work alongside] dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other [fantastic species]. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.
    - Not every [[intelligent race]] of the [[multiverse]] is appropriate for a [player-controlled adventurer]. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the [most common races] to [produce the sort of adventurers] who [make up typical parties]. Dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half­ orcs, and tieflings are [less common as] adventurers. Drow, a [[subrace]] of elves, are also uncommon.

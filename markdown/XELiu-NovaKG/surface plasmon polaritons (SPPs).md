- Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are [[electromagnetic wave]]s that travel along a [[metal–dielectric interface]] or [[metal–air interface]], practically in the [infrared](((8KzfnZDSj))) or [visible-frequency](((it-L_cjdx))). The term "surface plasmon polariton" explains that the wave involves both [[charge motion]] in the metal ("[[surface plasmon]]") and electromagnetic waves in the air or dielectric ("[[polariton]]").[1]

    - They are a type of [[surface wave]], [guided along the interface] [in much the same way] that [light can be guided by] an [[optical fiber]]. SPPs are [shorter in wavelength than] the [[incident light]] (photons).[2] Hence, SPPs can have tighter [[spatial confinement]] and higher [[local field intensity]].[2] [Perpendicular to the interface](((7yr-VUTdF))), they have [subwavelength-scale confinement](((9ZY2l4W2y))). An SPP will [propagate along the interface] [until its energy is lost] either to [absorption in the metal](((fZ6zF-dVg))) or [scattering into other directions] (such as into [[free space]]).

    - [Application of SPPs enables] [[subwavelength optics]] in [[microscopy]] and [[lithography]] beyond the [[diffraction limit]]. It also enables the first [steady-state micro-mechanical measurement](((-axYZ46NT))) of [a fundamental property of light itself]: [the momentum of a photon](((SnY7jjUOp))) in a [[dielectric medium]]. Other applications are [[photonic data storage]], [[light generation]], and [[bio-photonics]].[2][3][4][5]

- Excitation
    - SPPs [can be excited by] both electrons and photons. [Excitation by electrons](((JR5dtFZG8))) is created by [firing electrons into](((H_Se-Amuy))) [the bulk of a metal](((ofuw-7WZT))).[6] 向大块金属中发射电子 As the electrons scatter, [energy is transferred into](((G8VQ5vpja))) the [bulk plasma](((ofuw-7WZT))). The component of the [[scattering vector]] [parallel to the surface] [results in the formation of] [a surface plasmon polariton].[7]

    - For a photon to [excite an SPP], both must [have the same frequency and momentum]. However, for a given frequency, [a free-space photon]([[free-space photon]]) [has less momentum than] an SPP because the two have different [[dispersion relation]]s (see below). This [[momentum mismatch]] is the reason that [a free-space photon from air] cannot [couple directly to an SPP](((VonhxFERh))). For the same reason, an SPP [on a smooth metal surface] cannot [emit energy](((hIJcKi5B9))) as a free-space photon [into the dielectric] (if the dielectric is [uniform](((ylA8HGRnt)))). [This incompatibility is analogous to] [the lack of transmission] that occurs during [[total internal reflection]].
(入射光子的动量小于SPP, 动量不匹配导致两者之间无法直接耦合，能量无法直接转移，这类似于全内反射中的原理)
        - Nevertheless, [coupling of photons into SPPs](((VonhxFERh))) [can be achieved using] a [[coupling medium]] such as a [[prism]] or grating to match the photon and SPP [[wave vector]]s (and thus [match their momenta](((PuqhUxun-)))). A prism [can be positioned against] a [thin metal film] in the [Kretschmann configuration] or very close to a [[metal surface]] in the [Otto configuration] (Figure 1).

            - A [[grating coupler]] [matches the wave vectors] by [increasing the parallel wave vector component] [by an amount related to] the [[grating period]] (Figure 2). This method, while less frequently utilized, is critical to the [theoretical understanding] of the effect of [[surface roughness]]. Moreover, simple [isolated surface defects] such as a [[groove]], a [[slit]] or a [[corrugation]] [on an otherwise planar surface] [provide a mechanism] by which [[free-space radiation]] and SPs can [exchange energy] and hence couple.

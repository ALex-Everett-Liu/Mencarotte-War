- Noether's theorem or [Noether's first theorem] states that every [[differentiable symmetry]] of the [[action]] of a [[physical system]] with [[conservative force]]s has a corresponding [[conservation law]].[1] The theorem was proven by mathematician [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and published in 1918,[2] after a [[special case]] was proven by E. Cosserat and F. Cosserat in 1909.[3] [The action of a physical system] is the [integral over time](((AhT1VFxnA))) of a [[Lagrangian function]], from which the [system's behavior] [can be determined by] the [[principle of least action]]. This theorem [only applies to] [continuous and smooth symmetries] [over physical space].

    - Noether's theorem is used in [[theoretical physics]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. [A generalization of the formulations] on [[constants of motion]] in [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), [it does not apply to systems that] [cannot be modeled with] a [[Lagrangian]] alone (e.g., systems with a [[Rayleigh dissipation function]]). In particular, [[dissipative system]]s with [continuous symmetries]([[continuous symmetry]]) [need not have a corresponding conservation law].

- [Basic illustrations] and background
    - As an illustration, if a physical system [behaves the same regardless of] [how it is oriented in space](((QryUOD7g5))), its Lagrangian is symmetric under [[continuous rotation]]s: from this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates that the [[angular momentum]] of the system be conserved, [as a consequence of] [its laws of motion](((Jid5U4nGy))). The physical system itself [need not be symmetric]; [a jagged asteroid]([[asteroid]]) [tumbling in space] 凹凸不平的小行星 翻滚 [conserves angular momentum] [despite its asymmetry]. It is [the laws of its motion] that are symmetric.
(运动律的对称性而非是物体本身的对称性导致了作用量的守恒)

    - As another example, if a physical process exhibits the same outcomes regardless of place or time, then its Lagrangian is symmetric under continuous translations in space and time respectively: by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.
- [Informal statement] of the theorem
    - All fine [technical points] aside, Noether's theorem [can be stated informally]
        - [If a system has] a [continuous symmetry property], then there are [corresponding quantities] whose values are [conserved in time](((JqJ_IXFjl))).[5]
    - [A more sophisticated version of] the theorem [involving fields] states that:
        - To every differentiable symmetry generated by [[local action]]s there corresponds a [[conserved current]].
    - The word "symmetry" [in the above statement] [refers more precisely to] the [[covariance]] of the form that a [[physical law]] [takes with respect to] a one-dimensional [[Lie group]] of transformations [satisfying certain technical criteria]. [The conservation law of] a [[physical quantity]] is [usually expressed as] a [[continuity equation]].

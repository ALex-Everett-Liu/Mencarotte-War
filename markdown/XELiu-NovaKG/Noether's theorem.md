- Noether's theorem or [Noether's first theorem] states that every [[differentiable symmetry]] of the [[action]] of a [[physical system]] with [[conservative force]]s has a corresponding [[conservation law]].[1] The theorem was proven by mathematician [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and published in 1918,[2] after a [[special case]] was proven by E. Cosserat and F. Cosserat in 1909.[3] [The action of a physical system] is the [integral over time](((AhT1VFxnA))) of a [[Lagrangian function]], from which the [system's behavior] [can be determined by] the [[principle of least action]]. This theorem [only applies to] [continuous and smooth symmetries] [over physical space].

    - Noether's theorem is used in [[theoretical physics]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. [A generalization of the formulations] on [[constants of motion]] in [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), [it does not apply to systems that] [cannot be modeled with] a [[Lagrangian]] alone (e.g., systems with a [[Rayleigh dissipation function]]). In particular, [[dissipative system]]s with [continuous symmetries]([[continuous symmetry]]) [need not have a corresponding conservation law].

- [Basic illustrations] and background
    - As an illustration, if a physical system [behaves the same regardless of] [how it is oriented in space](((QryUOD7g5))), its Lagrangian is symmetric under [[continuous rotation]]s: from this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates that the [[angular momentum]] of the system be conserved, [as a consequence of] [its laws of motion](((Jid5U4nGy))). The physical system itself [need not be symmetric]; [a jagged asteroid]([[asteroid]]) [tumbling in space] 凹凸不平的小行星 翻滚 [conserves angular momentum] [despite its asymmetry]. It is [the laws of its motion] that are symmetric.
(若一物理系统无论其空间方位如何，行为始终相同，则其拉格朗日量必在连续旋转下对称-从而由运动定律得到角动量守恒-运动律的对称性而非是物体本身的对称性导致了作用量的守恒)

    - As another example, if a [[physical process]] [exhibits the same outcomes] [regardless of place or time], [then its Lagrangian is symmetric] [under continuous translations in space and time respectively]: by Noether's theorem, [these symmetries account for] the conservation laws of [linear momentum and energy] [within this system], respectively.[4]: 23 [5]: 261  
    - Noether's theorem is important, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also as a practical calculational tool. It allows investigators to determine the conserved quantities (invariants) from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it allows researchers to consider whole classes of hypothetical Lagrangians with given invariants, to describe a physical system.[3]: 127  As an illustration, suppose that a physical theory is proposed which conserves a quantity X. A researcher can calculate the types of Lagrangians that conserve X through a continuous symmetry. Due to Noether's theorem, the properties of these Lagrangians provide further criteria to understand the implications and judge the fitness of the new theory.
    - There are numerous versions of Noether's theorem, with varying degrees of generality. There are natural quantum counterparts of this theorem, expressed in the Ward–Takahashi identities. Generalizations of Noether's theorem to superspaces also exist.[6]
- [Informal statement] of the theorem
    - All fine [technical points] aside, Noether's theorem [can be stated informally]
        - [If a system has] a [continuous symmetry property], then there are [corresponding quantities] whose values are [conserved in time](((JqJ_IXFjl))).[5]
    - [A more sophisticated version of] the theorem [involving fields] states that:
        - To every differentiable symmetry generated by [[local action]]s there corresponds a [[conserved current]].
    - The word "symmetry" [in the above statement] [refers more precisely to] the [[covariance]] of the form that a [[physical law]] [takes with respect to] a one-dimensional [[Lie group]] of transformations [satisfying certain technical criteria]. [The conservation law of] a [[physical quantity]] is [usually expressed as] a [[continuity equation]].

- Historical context
    - Main articles: Constant of motion, conservation law, and conserved current
    - A conservation law states that some quantity X in the mathematical description of a system's evolution remains constant throughout its motion – it is an invariant. Mathematically, the rate of change of X (its derivative with respect to time) is zero,

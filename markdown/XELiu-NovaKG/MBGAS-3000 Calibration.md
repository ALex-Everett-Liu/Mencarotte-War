    - Reference Calibration
        - The MBGAS-3000TM gas analyzer must [acquire a new reference spectrum (zeroing) periodically] in [normal operation] to ensure that the [predicted values] are not [drifting outside of specification limits].
        - Variations of [[ambient temperature]] can also [change the zero value of] the analyzer.
        - [The quality of the reference] is highly dependent on [the stability of the purge gas composition].
            - § [Any variation of the composition of] the [system purge gas] due to contaminants, 污染物 within the [reference validity] period, may [impair the quality of the predictions] for that period. See “MBGAS-3000TM Gas Analyzer Hardware User Guide” for details about [purge requirements].

        - [The gains and offsets of gas concentrations] of the MBGAS- 3000 must be calibrated to ensure [[prediction accuracy]] and [minimize interferences between gases]
        - Change of FOV parameters, gas cell pressure or gas cell effective optical path length may modify the gains and offsets of the analyzer.
        - [The calibration of gains and offsets] [implies the measurement of] [pure or wet components] of [at least one concentration] in order to [minimize the calibration effort]. 以尽量减少校准工作
        - [The accuracy of the calibration relies on] the high [[linearity]] of MBGAS-3000 [predictor for gas concentrations] as well as [minimal interferences within calibration ranges].

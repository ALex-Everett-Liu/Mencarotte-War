    - Planescape: Torment is primarily [[story-driven]], with [[combat]] not being [prominently featured]. The [[protagonist]], known as [[The Nameless One]], is [an immortal man] who [forgets everything] [if killed]. The game [focuses on his journey through] the city of [[Sigil]] and other planes to [reclaim his memories] of these [previous lives], and to discover [why he was made immortal] [in the first place]. Several characters in the game may join the Nameless One on his journey; most of these characters have encountered him in the past or have been influenced by his actions in some way.

    - The game was not a commercial success, but received critical acclaim and has since become a cult classic. Claimed by video game journalists to be the best role-playing video game of 1999, it was lauded for its immersive dialogue, for the dark and relatively obscure Planescape setting, and for the protagonist's unique persona, which shirked many characteristics of traditional role-playing games. It is commonly considered one of the greatest video games of all time,[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] and continues to receive attention long after its release. An enhanced version, featuring enhancements made for modern platforms, was made by Beamdog and released for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS in April 2017, and for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in October 2019.

    - 虽然 rpg codex 给 pst [评了个][百大第一](https://bbs.saraba1st.com/2b/thread-2003231-2-1.html)，但你现在去codex发个谁是[crpg巅峰]的帖子（不[被版主口球]的话）[前十楼]可以有11个[不同的答案]，并在主楼[轻松收获]两位数 “retarded” 表情。
另外那11个里面[大概率不会有] pst，[但一定会有] ELEX #pt10-99.99
        - 就算是 codex 这种地方也分为 combatfag 和 storyfag 两种大类别，你让 combatfag 把异域镇魂曲[评成历史最佳][那必然是不可能的]，他们只会“互动小说”[糊脸][然后告诉你][这根本不算 RPG]，甚至不算 G。
        - codex 那边[巨魔浓度太高]所有游戏[都会有人说是垃圾]的，不过辐射 1,2 和 NV 相对来说[比较平衡]，不太像博得和异域一样[短板明显]。
        - NV 战斗因为有各种[客制子弹]可能是辐射里最好的。[老辐射][战斗的优点][基本仅限于][部位瞄准]和[暴击表]的[精心设计]，防具 itemization 就是avg水平，[穿甲弹]计算还是bug的，队友[人工智障]。
            - 奥秘就不要谈战斗了……近战火斧无双，法师Harm无双，就算用[科技打枪build]也就是[回合制射射射]，唯一的乐趣就是[带一队机械蜘蛛宝宝]，然而[气氛意义]大于[实际价值]
            - [兼顾叙事和战斗]的[主流作品]里最好的我认为是[博得1]，博得2[叙事弱一点]但也是综合性的佳作。
        - [博德之门2][的确经典]，[异域镇魂曲]主要是有种独特的[异度风景]范，整个[外域]撇掉[巴佬]，[随便拉个会喘气的生物]要么体现了要么[正在思考某种规则]或者哲学，可惜官方后面看[山口山]火了瞎JB改，[后面版本里的]外域都[变成了什么玩意]

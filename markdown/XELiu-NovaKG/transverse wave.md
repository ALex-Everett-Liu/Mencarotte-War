- In physics, a transverse wave is a wave whose [oscillations](((vG_IawJYT))) are [perpendicular to the direction](((GOu60DASf))) of the wave. This is in contrast to a [[longitudinal wave]] which [travels in the direction of its oscillations].
(传播方向与振动方向)
    - A simple example is given by the [waves](((R90V_Iiy9))) that can be created on [a horizontal length of string] by [anchoring one end](((movcYbcgz))) 锚定一端 and [moving the other end up and down]. 
    - Another example is the waves that are created on [the membrane of a drum](((UCRwRS-Ve))). The waves [propagate in directions] that are parallel to the membrane plane, but the membrane itself [gets displaced up and down], perpendicular to that plane.

    - Light is another example of a transverse wave, where the oscillations are [the electric and magnetic fields], which [point at right angles to](((8zq5OvAch))) 成直角 the [ideal light rays] that [describe the direction of propagation](((c1JBNUrAU))).

- Transverse waves commonly occur in [[elastic solid]]s; the oscillations in this case are the [[displacement]] of the solid particles away from their [[relaxed position]], 松弛位置 [in directions perpendicular to] [the propagation of the wave]. Since those displacements correspond to a [[local shear deformation]] 局部剪切变形 of the material, a transverse wave of this nature is called a [[shear wave]]. In [[seismology]], shear waves are also called [secondary waves or S-waves](((UPhilQlK1))).

    - Transverse waves are contrasted with longitudinal waves, where the oscillations [occur in the direction of the wave]. The [standard example] of a longitudinal wave is a [[sound wave]] or "pressure wave" in gases, 压力波 liquids, or solids, whose oscillations cause [compression and expansion of the material](((wSxgj-r6_))) [through which the wave is propagating]. [[pressure wave]]s are called "primary waves", or "P-waves" in geophysics.

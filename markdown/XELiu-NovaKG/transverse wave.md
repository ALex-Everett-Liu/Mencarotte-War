- In physics, a transverse wave is a wave whose [oscillations](((vG_IawJYT))) are [perpendicular to the direction]() of the wave. This is in contrast to a [[longitudinal wave]] which [travels in the direction of its oscillations].

    - A simple example is given by the [waves](((R90V_Iiy9))) that can be created on [a horizontal length of string] by [anchoring one end](((movcYbcgz))) 锚定一端 and [moving the other end up and down]. 
    - Another example is the waves that are created on [the membrane of a drum](((UCRwRS-Ve))). The waves [propagate in directions] that are parallel to the membrane plane, but the membrane itself [gets displaced up and down], perpendicular to that plane.

    - Light is another example of a transverse wave, where the oscillations are [the electric and magnetic fields], which [point at right angles to](((b0jAfz5k3))) 成直角 the [ideal light rays] that [describe the direction of propagation](((c1JBNUrAU))).

            - [Electromagnetic waves](http://weelookang.blogspot.com/2011/10/ejs-open-source-propagation-of.html) can be imagined as a [self-propagating transverse oscillating wave] 自传播横向振荡波 of [electric and magnetic fields]. This diagram shows [a plane linearly polarized wave] [propagating from left to right]. The electric field is in a [vertical plane] and the magnetic field in a [horizontal plane].

    - [Propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ondes_cisaillement_2d_20_petit.gif) of a [transverse spherical wave](((qcVw17MQg))) in a [2d grid] 二维网格 ([empirical model]) 
- Transverse waves commonly occur in [[elastic solid]]s; the oscillations in this case are the [[displacement]] of the solid particles away from their [[relaxed position]], 松弛位置 [in directions perpendicular to] [the propagation of the wave]. Since those displacements correspond to a [[local shear deformation]] 局部剪切变形 of the material, a transverse wave of this nature is called a [[shear wave]]. In [[seismology]], shear waves are also called [secondary waves or S-waves](((UPhilQlK1))).

    - Transverse waves are contrasted with longitudinal waves, where the oscillations [occur in the direction of the wave]. The [standard example] of a longitudinal wave is a [[sound wave]] or "pressure wave" in gases, 压力波 liquids, or solids, whose oscillations cause [compression and expansion of the material](((wSxgj-r6_))) [through which the wave is propagating]. [[pressure wave]]s are called "primary waves", or "P-waves" in geophysics.

    - [Illustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Onde_cisaillement_impulsion_1d_30_petit.gif) of a simple (plane) transverse wave propagating through an [[elastic medium]] [in the horizontal direction], with particles being displaced [in the vertical direction](((71JKD_6Zu))). Only one layer of the material is shown

- Mathematical formulation
    - Mathematically, the simplest kind of transverse wave is [a plane linearly polarized sinusoidal one]. "[Plane]([[plane wave]])" here means that [the direction of propagation] is unchanging and [the same over the whole medium]; "[[linearly polarized]]" means that the direction of displacement too is unchanging and the same over the whole medium; and [the magnitude of the displacement] is a [[sinusoidal function]] only of time and of position [along the direction of propagation].

    - [The motion of such a wave] can be [expressed mathematically] as follows. Let d be the direction of propagation (a vector with unit length), and o any [[reference point]] 参考点 in the medium. Let u be [the direction of the oscillations](((W3cPnk7k5))) (another [unit-length vector](((TkBIxr7a8))) perpendicular to d). The displacement of a particle at any point p of the medium and any time t (seconds) will be   (介质平面波-粒子在任意时刻任意一点p的位移公式)
$$\displaystyle S(p,t)=Au\sin {\left({\frac {t-(p-o)\cdot {\frac {d}{v}}}{T}}+\phi \right)}$$
        - where __A__ is the wave's **amplitude** or **strength**, __T__ is its **period**, __v__ is the **speed** of propagation, and __φ__ is its **phase** at __o__. All these parameters are [real numbers]. The symbol "•" denotes the [[inner product]] of two vectors.
        - By this equation, the wave [travels in the direction] __d__ and the oscillations [occur back and forth along the direction] __u__. The wave is said to be [linearly polarized in the direction] __u__.

        - An observer that looks at a [[fixed point]] __p__ will see the particle there move in a simple [harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion) (sinusoidal) motion with period __T__ seconds, with [maximum particle displacement] __A__ in each sense; 检测, 觉察 that is, with a **frequency** of __f__ = 1/__T__ [full oscillation cycles] every second. A snapshot of all particles at a fixed time __t__ will show the same displacement for all particles on each plane perpendicular to __d__, with the displacements in successive planes forming a sinusoidal pattern, with each full cycle extending along __d__ by the **wavelength** __λ__ = __v__ __T__ = __v__/__f__. The whole pattern moves in the direction __d__ with speed __V__. #[[simple harmonic motion]]

        - The same equation describes a plane linearly polarized sinusoidal light wave, except that the "displacement" __S__(__p__, __t__) is the electric field at point __p__ and time __t__. (The magnetic field will be described by the same equation, but with a "displacement" direction that is perpendicular to both __d__ and __u__, and a different amplitude.)

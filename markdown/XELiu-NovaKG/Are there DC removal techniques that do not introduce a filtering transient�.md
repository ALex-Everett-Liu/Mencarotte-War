- [I have an application in which I need to] [remove DC components] from a [sampled signal](((wu7eoctCj))) [in real time] (basically the same constraints of ECG, but it has nothing to do with the brain). My measured signal in in the single µV range and the undesired offset wanders around and can be as high as tens of mV.
    - In this application, fast electrical stimulation is introduced which can reach hundreds of volts and can introduce a measurement artifact of nearly a volt. This stimulus is basically an impulse from the point of view of the processing.

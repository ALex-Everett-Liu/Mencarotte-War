- A mirror image (in a [[plane mirror]]) is a [reflected duplication]([[duplication]]) of an object that [appears almost identical]([[identical]]), but is [[reversed]] [in the direction perpendicular to]([[perpendicular direction]]) the [[mirror surface]]. As an [[optical effect]] it results from [reflection off from]([[reflection]]) [[substance]]s such as a mirror or [[water]]. It is also a concept in [[geometry]] and [can be used as] a [[conceptualization process]] for [[3-D structure]]s.

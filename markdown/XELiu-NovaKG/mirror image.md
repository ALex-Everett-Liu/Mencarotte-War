- A mirror image (in a [[plane mirror]]) is a [reflected duplication]([[duplication]]) of an object that [appears almost identical]([[identical]]), but is [[reversed]] [in the direction perpendicular to]([[perpendicular direction]]) the [[mirror surface]]. As an [[optical effect]] it results from [reflection off from]([[reflection]]) [[substance]]s such as a mirror or [[water]]. It is also a concept in [[geometry]] and [can be used as] a [[conceptualization process]] for [[3-D structure]]s.

- ### [[systems of mirrors]]
    - In the case of two mirrors, in planes at an angle α, [looking through both] from the [[sector]] which is [the intersection of the two halfspaces]([[intersection]]), is like looking at a version of the world [[rotated]] by an angle of 2α; [the points of observations] and directions of [looking for which this applies] correspond to those for looking through a [[frame]] like that of [the first mirror], and [a frame at the mirror image] 镜框 with [respect to the first plane], of the second mirror. If the mirrors have [[vertical edge]]s then the left edge of the [[field of view]] is the plane through the right edge of the first mirror and the edge of the second mirror which is on the right [when looked at directly], but on the left in the mirror image.
    - In the case of two [[parallel mirrors]], [looking through both at once] is like [looking at a version of the world which] is translated by [twice the distance] between the mirrors, in the direction perpendicular to them, away from the [[observer]]. Since [the plane of the mirror]([[mirror plane]]) in which [one looks directly] is beyond that of [the other mirror], one always looks at an [[oblique angle]], and the [[translation]] [just mentioned] has not only a [[component]] [away from the observer], but also one in a [[perpendicular direction]]. 
        - The [[translated view]] [can also be described by] a translation of the observer in [[opposite direction]]. For example, with a [[vertical periscope]], [the shift of the world]([[shift]]) is [away from the observer] and down, both by [the length of the periscope], but [it is more practical to consider] the [[equivalent shift]] of the observer: up, and backward.
    - [It is also possible to] create a [[non-reversing mirror]] by placing two [[first surface mirror]]s at 90º to [give an image]([[image]]) [which is not reversed].

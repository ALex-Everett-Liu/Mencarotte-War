- ## Overview
    - [One of the key concepts in] [[electronics]] is the [[printed circuit board (PCB)]] or PCB. [It's so fundamental that] [people often forget to explain] what a PCB __is__. This [[tutorial]] will breakdown [what makes up a PCB] and [some of the common terms used in] the [PCB world].
    - Over the next few pages, [we'll discuss] the composition of a printed circuit board, cover some [[terminology]], a look at [methods of assembly], and [discuss briefly] the [design process] behind [creating a new PCB].

- ## What's a PCB?
    - Printed circuit board is [the most common name] but may also be called "printed wiring boards" or "printed wiring cards". [Before the advent of] the PCB circuits were [constructed through a laborious process] of [[point-to-point wiring]]. [This led to frequent failures] at [[wire junction]]s and [[short circuit]]s when [[wire insulation]] [began to age and crack]. 绝缘层开始老化和开裂时

        - [A significant advance] was the development of [wire wrapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wrap), where [a small gauge wire] is [literally wrapped around a post] 一根小规格的金属丝缠绕在一根柱子上 at each [[connection point]], creating a [[gas-tight connection]] which is highly durable and easily changeable. #[[wire wrap]]
    - As electronics moved from [[vacuum tube]]s and relays to [[silicon]] and [[integrated circuit]]s, [the size and cost of](((b2pD9dylf))) [[electronic component]]s [began to decrease]. Electronics [became more prevalent in](((CAAXa62nz))) [[consumer goods]], and the pressure to [reduce the size] and [[manufacturing cost]]s of [[electronic product]]s [drove manufacturers to look for better solutions]. Thus was born the PCB.

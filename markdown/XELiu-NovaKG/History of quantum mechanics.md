- [Scientific inquiry]([[scientific inquiry]]) into [[the wave nature of light]] began in the 17th and 18th centuries, when scientists such as [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christiaan Huygens]] and [[Leonhard Euler]] proposed a [[the wave theory of light]] based on [[experimental observation]]s.[5] In 1803 English polymath [[Thomas Young]] described the famous [[double-slit experiment]].[6] This experiment [played a major role in] [the general acceptance of]([[acceptance]]) [the wave theory of light].

- The [[foundation]]s of quantum mechanics were established [during the first half of the 20th century] by Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Louis de Broglie, Arthur Compton, Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, Erwin Schrödinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi, Wolfgang Pauli, Max von Laue, Freeman Dyson, David Hilbert, Wilhelm Wien, Satyendra Nath Bose, Arnold Sommerfeld, and others. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of Niels Bohr [became widely accepted].
- In 1838 [[Michael Faraday]] discovered [[cathode ray]]s. These studies were followed by the 1859 statement of the [black-body radiation problem] by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], the 1877 suggestion by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] that the [[energy state]]s of a [[physical system]] can be [[discrete]], and the 1900 [[quantum hypothesis]] of Max Planck.[7] Planck's hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete "quanta" (or [[energy packet]]s) [precisely matched]([[match]]) the [observed patterns] of [[black-body radiation]].

    - In 1896 [[Wilhelm Wien]] [empirically determined]([[empirical law]]) a [[distribution law]] of black-body radiation,[8] called [[Wien's law]]. Ludwig Boltzmann [independently arrived at this result] [by considerations of] [[Maxwell's equations]]. However, it was [valid only at] [[high frequencies]] and underestimated the [[radiance]] [at low frequencies].

    - Max Planck [corrected this model] using Ludwig Boltzmann's [[statistical interpretation]] of [[thermodynamics]] and proposed [what is now called] [[Planck's law]], which [led to the development of] quantum mechanics. After [Planck's solution] in 1900 to the [black-body radiation problem] (reported 1859), [[Albert Einstein]] offered a [[quantum-based]] explanation of the [photoelectric effect] (1905, reported 1887). Around 1900–1910, the [[atomic theory]] but not the [[corpuscular theory]] of light[9] [first came to be] [widely accepted] as [[scientific fact]]; these latter theories [can be considered] [quantum theories]([[quantum theory]]) of [[matter]] and [[electromagnetic radiation]], respectively. 物质和电磁辐射各自的量子理论版本 However, the [[photon theory]] was [not widely accepted until] about 1915. Even until Einstein's [[Nobel Prize]], Niels Bohr [did not believe in] the photon.[10]

- Telecommunication is [the transmission of information](((GQi11qfmQ))) [by various types of technologies] over wire, radio, optical or other [[electromagnetic system]]s.[1][2] [It has its origin in] [the desire of humans for] [communication over a distance] greater than that [feasible with the human voice]([[human voice]]), but [with a similar scale of expediency]; 适宜性 thus, [slow systems] (such as [[postal mail]]) are [excluded from the field].

    - The [[transmission media]] in telecommunication have [evolved through numerous stages of technology], from [[beacon]]s and other [[visual signal]]s (such as [smoke signals](((eeerAXRTp))), [semaphore telegraphs](((OK5DWZF9r))), [[signal flag]]s, and [[optical heliograph]]s), to [[electrical cable]] and [[electromagnetic radiation]], including light. Such [[transmission path]]s are often divided into [[communication channel]]s, which [afford the advantages of] [multiplexing](((xT92A0HRb))) multiple [concurrent communication sessions](((JOVXLbIdf))). 多路复用多个并发通信会话 Telecommunication is often used in its [plural form](((ysSRt7QuS))), because it [involves many different technologies].[3]

- Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages, such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, television and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, optical fiber, and communications satellites.

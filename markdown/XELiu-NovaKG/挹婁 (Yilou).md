- 挹婁（ゆうろう、拼音: Yìlóu）は、[後漢から][五胡十六国時代]（1世紀から4世紀）にかけて、[外満州]付近に存在したとされる民族。
Yilou is the modern Chinese name of a people in 3rd- to 6th-century Manchuria.
- In some sources, [their name was also written as] Sushen, after [an earlier people] that were [traditionally thought to be] [from the same region]. Although it is common to link the Yilou to the earlier Sushen or the later Mohe (and hence to the Jurchens who [founded the Jin Dynasty] and the Manchus who founded the Qing), such connections [remain unclear], and the groups may even be [from different regions] entirely. [Some historians think that](((RKqxBmCCS))) the Chinese, [having heard that] the Yilou [paid arrows as tribute], simply linked them with the Sushen [based on ancient records] [recording a similar practice].[1](((HxKZM8_zn)))

    - The Yilou [paid tribute several times], [pleasing the rulers] of [northern China]. According to the 3rd-century [classical Chinese text] __[Records of the Three Kingdoms]__, they were subjects of [[扶余 (Buyeo)]] from Han times until [a successful rebellion] [in the 3rd century].

        - 漢代以降は[夫余に従属していた]が、夫余が[重税を課した]ため、魏の[黄初年間]（220年 - 226年）に[反乱を起こした](Hanran o okoshita)。夫余は何度か挹婁を[討伐した](Tōbatsu shita)が、独立し魏への[朝貢を行った]。

    - On the [who] thing about historians [disagreeing with Yilou/Sushen connection]
        - I was just randomly reading this article and [don't have the time to figure out] [how to edit this properly] myself right now, but in case someone wants to, the historian Mark E. Byington asserts that in his book "The Ancient State of Puyo in Northeast Asia":
            - "From the end of the [Eastern Han period] (25–220), however, we see the [first appearance in Chinese records] of a people called the Yilou 挹 婁, a [subject people] of Puyŏ who are [described in various works as] being the descendents of [the ancient Sushen people].24 [In some works] the names Sushen and Yilou are [used interchangeably]. [Historical geography] [from Han times] and later show the Yilou to have been located in the valley of the [[牡丹江 (Mudan River)]] [in southeastern Heilongjiang] near the Qing-period city of Ningguta 寧古塔.
210509-06:10
            - Although many [Chinese scholars] [simply assume], based on this information, that the Sushen of the early Zhou were [located in eastern Manchuria] and use this to demonstrate that Zhou’s influence [had reached to such extremes], [it is much more likely that] [two different groups] are indicated. [It is almost inconceivable that] news of King Cheng’s defeat of the [Eastern Yi of Shandong] could [reach the ears of people] in the Mudan valley and prompt [a congratulatory mission] [sent to such a distant realm]. Some scholars, [insisting that] the early Zhou Sushen and the late Han Yilou [must have been the same group], theorize that [a large-scale migration] was responsible for the [apparent disjunction in the history] of this [ancient people]. Yet the [[archaeology]] of the Mudan River region [not only indicates that] [the people occupying that region] [in the Han period] [were indigenous to eastern Manchuria] but also [reveals a lack of similarity between] [the cultures of North China] and this region. 
                - It is rather more likely, as with the case of the Eastern Yi, that the name of the ancient Sushen was [applied during the Han or Wei periods] to a different border people, the Han and Wei borders [reaching much farther east than] did those of Zhou. **[It is possible that] when the Yilou [presented a tribute of arrows to] the Han or Wei** courts, [the historians of those courts] were reminded of the ancient Sushen and [assumed a connection].** Alternatively, the association with the Sushen may [have been deliberately emphasized]** to reinforce Han’s (and especially Wei’s) own association with the [ancient Zhou kings], whose [[authority]] was such that [remote border tribes] willingly offered their allegiance in the form of [tribute missions]([[tribute]]).27"

- History
    - 古の粛慎（しゅくしん）の[末裔](matsuei)とされ、魏代・晋代でもそのまま粛慎[と呼ばれ続けた]。挹婁の呼称は、[彼等自身の自称]ではなく、鏃（yoro）、箭や後の牛禄（niru）、坑（yeru）などの[音訳]と考えられている[1]。

- Accounts by outsiders
    - The [[三国志 (Records of the Three Kingdoms)]] records that the Yilou were located more than a thousand li[3](((guGMrS2cT))) north of Buyeo [in forests covering mountainous terrain] that had formerly been the kingdom of the Sushen clan. The text reports that, although the Yilou were [subjects of Buyeo], they did not [speak the same language as] the people of Buyeo and [[高丽 (Goryeo)]]. [The text's author] did not know the [northern extent] of Yilou territory, but they reportedly [had access to the sea], as they [sailed in boats] to [plunder other kingdoms]. The text notes that the Yilou were [the most undisciplined] of the [Eastern Barbarians], 最不守纪律的 as they were the only ones not to use [sacrifical vessels] for [food and drink].[4] 器皿

    - According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the Yilou had access to grain, cattle, horses, and sackcloth, 粗麻布衣 and they produced [[red jade]] and good-quality [[sable skin]]s, for which they were well known. The Yilou were [talented archers]([[archer]]) and [had a tendency to] [poison their arrowtips] so that anyone they [hit with their arrows] died. They [raised pigs for] [food and clothing], and they [smeared themselves with] [pig fat] in winter to [protect themselves from the cold]. Settlements were [centred around pig pens], and homes were typically [pit houses], with those of the [wealthy families] [descending as far as nine steps below ground]. They apparently [had no single ruler]; instead, [each settlement] [had its own head](((cKrI8GYQ6))) (Chinese: 大人; pinyin: dàren).[4](((176_QMh7A)))

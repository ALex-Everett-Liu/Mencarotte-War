- Yilou is the modern Chinese name of a people in 3rd- to 6th-century Manchuria.
- In some sources, [their name was also written as] Sushen, after [an earlier people] that were [traditionally thought to be] [from the same region]. Although it is common to link the Yilou to the earlier Sushen or the later Mohe (and hence to the Jurchens who [founded the Jin Dynasty] and the Manchus who founded the Qing), such connections [remain unclear], and the groups may even be [from different regions] entirely. [Some historians think that](((RKqxBmCCS))) the Chinese, [having heard that] the Yilou [paid arrows as tribute], simply linked them with the Sushen [based on ancient records] [recording a similar practice].[1](((HxKZM8_zn)))

    - The Yilou [paid tribute several times], [pleasing the rulers] of [northern China]. According to the 3rd-century [classical Chinese text] __[Records of the Three Kingdoms]__, they were subjects of [[扶余 (Buyeo)]] from Han times until [a successful rebellion] [in the 3rd century].

    - The Yilou [disappeared from documents] [in the 6th century]. The [[靺鞨 (Mohe)]] [rose into power] there instead.[2]
- Accounts by outsiders
    - The [[三国志 (Records of the Three Kingdoms)]] records that the Yilou were located more than a thousand li[3] north of Buyeo [in forests covering mountainous terrain] that had formerly been the kingdom of the Sushen clan. The text reports that, although the Yilou were [subjects of Buyeo], they did not [speak the same language as] the people of Buyeo and [[高丽 (Goryeo)]]. [The text's author] did not know the [northern extent] of Yilou territory, but they reportedly [had access to the sea], as they [sailed in boats] to [plunder other kingdoms]. The text notes that the Yilou were [the most undisciplined] of the [Eastern Barbarians], 最不守纪律的 as they were the only ones not to use [sacrifical vessels] for [food and drink].[4] 器皿

    - According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the Yilou had access to grain, cattle, horses, and sackcloth, 粗麻布衣 and they produced [[red jade]] and good-quality [[sable skin]]s, for which they were well known. The Yilou were [talented archers]([[archer]]) and [had a tendency to] [poison their arrowtips] so that anyone they [hit with their arrows] died. They [raised pigs for] [food and clothing], and they [smeared themselves with] [pig fat] in winter to [protect themselves from the cold]. Settlements were [centred around pig pens], and homes were typically [pit houses], with those of the [wealthy families] [descending as far as nine steps below ground]. They apparently [had no single ruler]; instead, [each settlement] [had its own head](((cKrI8GYQ6))) (Chinese: 大人; pinyin: dàren).[4]

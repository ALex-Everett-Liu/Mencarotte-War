- Org-mode was created by Carsten Dominik in 2003, originally to organize his own life and work,[3] and since the first release numerous other users and developers have contributed to this free software package.[4] Emacs includes Org-mode[5] as a major mode by default. Bastien Guerry is the current maintainer, in cooperation with an active development community.[6] Since its success in Emacs, some other systems now provide functions to work with org files.[7][8]
- Almost orthogonally, Org-mode has functionalities aimed at executing code in various external languages; these functionalities form org-babel.[9][10]

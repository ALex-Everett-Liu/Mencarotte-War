The name is used to [encompass](((jn2QX0bmE))) [plain text files]([[plain text]]) ("[[org file]]s") that [include simple marks] to [indicate levels of a hierarchy]([[hierarchical level]]) (such as [the outline of an essay]([[outline]]), a topic list with subtopics, nested computer code, etc.), and an editor with functions that can [read the markup] and [manipulate hierarchy elements] (expand/hide elements, move blocks of elements, check off [[to-do list]] items, etc.).

    - Org-mode was created by [[Carsten Dominik]] in 2003, originally to [organize his own life and work]([[organization tool]]),[3] and [since the first release] [numerous other users] and developers have contributed to this [free software package].[4] Emacs includes Org-mode[5] [as a major mode by default]. Bastien Guerry is the [current maintainer]([[maintainer]]), in cooperation with [an active development community]([[development community]]).[6] Since its success in Emacs, some other systems now [provide functions to work with] org files.[7][8]

- System
    - The Org-mode [[home page]] explains that "at its core, Org-mode is [a simple outliner] for note-taking and [[list management]]"[11] The [Org system] author Carsten Dominik explains that "Org-mode does outlining, note-taking, [[hyperlink]]s, [[spreadsheet]]s, [[TODO list]]s, [[project planning]], [[GTD]], [HTML and LaTeX authoring](((NdulT-Y_7))), all with plain text files in Emacs."[12]
    - The Org system is based on plain text files [with a simple markup]([[markup]]), which makes the files very [[portable]]. The [Linux Information Project] explains that "Plain text is supported by nearly every [[application program]] on every [[operating system (OS)]]".[13]
    - The system includes [a lightweight markup language]([[markup language]]) for plain text files (similar in function to [[Markdown]], [[reStructuredText]], Textile, etc., with a different implementation), allowing [lines or sections of plain text] to be [hierarchically divided], tagged, linked, and so on.

- Historically in philosophy, now science, a first principle is a basic proposition or assumption that [cannot be deduced from any other] [[proposition]] or [[assumption]]. First principles are from [[First Cause]][1] attitudes and taught by [[Aristotelian]]s, and [nuanced versions] of first principles are [referred to as postulates by] [[Kantian]]s.[2] In mathematics, first principles are referred to as [[axiom]]s or [[postulate]]s. 
    - [First principles thinking] consists of deriving things to 将事物推导到 their [fundamental proven axioms] 基本的已证实的公理 [in the given arena], 在给定领域中的 [before reasoning up] by asking which ones are [relevant to the question at hand], then [cross referencing conclusions](((3DpiuYci8))) [based on chosen axioms] and [making sure conclusions] [don't violate any fundamental laws]([[fundamental law]]). Physicists include [[counterintuitive concept]]s with [[reiteration]].

- In [[formal logic]]
    - In a [formal logical system], that is, [a set of propositions]([[proposition]]) that are [consistent with one another], it is possible that [some of the statements]([[statement]]) [can be deduced from other statements]. For example, in the [[syllogism]], "All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal" [the last claim]([[claim]]) [can be deduced from the first two].

    - A first principle is an axiom that [cannot be deduced from any other] [within that system]. The [classic example](((Ppbz-T5pN))) is that of [[Euclid's Elements]]; its hundreds of [[geometric proposition]]s can be deduced from [a set of definitions], postulates, and [[common notion]]s: [all three types] [constitute first principles].
- Philosophy in general
    - In philosophy "first principles" are from First Cause[3] attitudes commonly referred to as [a priori terms and arguments]([[a priori]]), which are contrasted to [a posteriori terms, reasoning or arguments]([[a posteriori]]), in that the former is [simply assumed and exist] [prior to the reasoning process] and the latter are [deduced or inferred] [after the initial reasoning process]([[reasoning process]]). First principles are [generally treated in the realm of philosophy] known as [[epistemology]], but are [an important factor] in any [[metaphysical speculation]].
220923-20:24
    - In philosophy "first principles" are [often somewhat synonymous with] a priori, datum (论据, 材料, 基准) and [[axiomatic reasoning]].
- Aristotle
    - [Terence Irwin] writes:
        - When Aristotle [explains in general terms] [what he tries to do] in his [philosophical works], he says [he is looking for] "first principles" (or "origins"; archai):
            - In every [systematic inquiry (methodos)] 系统探究 where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from [acquiring knowledge of these]; for we think we know something just in case we [acquire knowledge of] the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements. It is clear, then, that in the science of nature as elsewhere, we should try first to determine questions about the first principles. The naturally proper direction of our road is from things better known and clearer to us, to things that are clearer and better known by nature; for the things that are known to us are not the same as the things known unconditionally (haplôs). Hence it is necessary for us to progress, following this procedure, from the things that are less clear by nature, but clearer to us, towards things that are clearer and better known by nature. (Phys. 184a10–21)
        - The connection between knowledge and first principles is not axiomatic as expressed in Aristotle's account of a first principle (in one sense) as "the first basis from which a thing is known" (Met. 1013a14–15). The search for first principles is not peculiar to philosophy; philosophy shares this aim with biological, meteorological, and historical inquiries, among others. But Aristotle's references to first principles in this opening passage of the Physics and at the start of other philosophical inquiries imply that it is a primary task of philosophy.[4]
- Descartes
    - [Profoundly influenced by] [[Euclid]], [[Descartes]] was a [[rationalist]] who invented [the foundationalist system of philosophy]([[foundationalist]]). 基础主义哲学体系 He used the method of doubt, now called [[Cartesian doubt]], to [systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt] [until he was left with what he saw as] [purely indubitable truths]. Using these [self-evident propositions] as his axioms, or foundations, [he went on to deduce] his [entire body of knowledge] from them. The foundations are also called [[a priori truth]]s. [His most famous proposition] is "Je pense, donc je suis" (I think, therefore I am, or Cogito ergo sum), which he indicated in his [Discourse on the Method] was "the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search."

    - Descartes [describes the concept of] a first principle [in the following excerpt from the preface to] the [Principles of Philosophy] (1644):
        - I should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, 从最常见的事情开始 as, for example, that the word philosophy [signifies the study of wisdom], and that by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in [the management of affairs], 管理事务上的审慎 but [a perfect knowledge of] all [that man can know], as well for [the conduct of his life] as for [the preservation of his health] and [the discovery of all the arts], and that knowledge to subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called [284] philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of those first causes which are called Principles. Now, these principles must possess two conditions: in the first place, they must be so clear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers them, cannot doubt their truth; in the second place, the knowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that though the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what depends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from the former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavor so to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that depend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of deductions which is not perfectly manifest.[5]
- In physics
    - In physics and [other sciences], a [[calculation]] or [[theoretical work]] is said to be from first principles, or [[ab initio]], if it [starts directly at the level of established science] 既定的科学层面 (if it [starts directly at the level of established laws] of physics) and [does not make assumptions such as] [[empirical model]] and [[parameter fitting]]. 
    - For example, calculation of [[electronic structure]] using [[Schrödinger's equation]] [within a set of approximations]([[approximation]]) that do not include [fitting the model to] [[experimental data]] is an [[ab initio approach]].

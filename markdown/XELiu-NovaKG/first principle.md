- Historically in philosophy, now science, a first principle is a basic proposition or assumption that [cannot be deduced from any other] [[proposition]] or [[assumption]]. First principles are from [[First Cause]][1] attitudes and taught by [[Aristotelian]]s, and [nuanced versions] of first principles are [referred to as postulates by] [[Kantian]]s.[2] In mathematics, first principles are referred to as [[axiom]]s or [[postulate]]s. 
    - [First principles thinking] consists of deriving things to 将事物推导到 their [fundamental proven axioms] 基本的已证实的公理 [in the given arena], 在给定领域中的 [before reasoning up] by asking which ones are [relevant to the question at hand], then [cross referencing conclusions](((3DpiuYci8))) [based on chosen axioms] and [making sure conclusions] [don't violate any fundamental laws]([[fundamental law]]). Physicists include [[counterintuitive concept]]s with [[reiteration]].

- In [[formal logic]]
    - In a [formal logical system], that is, [a set of propositions]([[proposition]]) that are [consistent with one another], it is possible that [some of the statements]([[statement]]) [can be deduced from other statements]. For example, in the [[syllogism]], "All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal" [the last claim]([[claim]]) [can be deduced from the first two].

    - A first principle is an axiom that [cannot be deduced from any other] [within that system]. The [classic example](((Ppbz-T5pN))) is that of [[Euclid's Elements]]; its hundreds of [[geometric proposition]]s can be deduced from [a set of definitions], postulates, and [[common notion]]s: [all three types] [constitute first principles].
- In physics
    - In physics and [other sciences], a [[calculation]] or [[theoretical work]] is said to be from first principles, or [[ab initio]], if it [starts directly at the level of established science] 既定的科学层面 (if it [starts directly at the level of established laws] of physics) and [does not make assumptions such as] [[empirical model]] and [[parameter fitting]]. 
    - For example, calculation of [[electronic structure]] using [[Schrödinger's equation]] [within a set of approximations]([[approximation]]) that do not include [fitting the model to] [[experimental data]] is an [[ab initio approach]].

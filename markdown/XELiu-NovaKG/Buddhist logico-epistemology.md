- Buddhist logico-epistemology is a term used in [Western scholarship] for [pramāṇa-vāda (doctrine of proof)] 证明学 and [Hetu-vidya (science of causes)]. Pramāṇa-vāda is an [epistemological study]([[epistemology]]) of [the nature of knowledge]; Hetu-vidya is [a system of logic].[1] These models [developed in India] [during the 5th through 7th centuries].

    - The [early Buddhist texts] show that [the historical Buddha] was familiar with [certain rules of reasoning] [used for debating purposes] and [made use of these] [against his opponents]. He also seems to [have held certain ideas about] [epistemology and reasoning], though he [did not put forth] a [logico-epistemological system]. The structure of [debating rules and processes] can be seen in [the early Theravada text]([[Theravada]]) the Kathāvatthu.
    - The first Buddhist thinker to discuss logical and epistemic issues systematically was Vasubandhu in his Vāda-vidhi ("A Method for Argumentation"), who was influenced by the Hindu work on reasoning, the Nyāya-sūtra.[2]
    - A mature system of Buddhist logic and epistemology was founded by the Buddhist scholar Dignāga (c. 480–540 CE) in his magnum opus, the Pramāṇa-samuccaya.[3][4] Dharmakirti further developed this system with several innovations. Dharmakirti's Pramanavarttika ('Commentary on Valid Cognition') became the main source of epistemology and reasoning in Tibetan Buddhism.[5]

- 綢繆束薪、三星在天。
今夕何夕、見此良人。
子兮子兮、如此良人何。
    - 绸缪：缠绕，捆束。犹缠绵也。
    - 《诗经》中大部分关于[男女婚事][常言及]“薪”
        - 束薪：喻夫妇同心，情意缠绵，[后成为][婚姻礼]。
    - 三星：即参星
    - Round and round the firewood is bound;
And the Three Stars [appear in the sky].
This evening is what evening,
That I see this good man?
O me! O me!
That I should get a good man like this!
    - (She):
The [firewood bundles] are [tied and bound],
[Aloft in the heavens] the Three Stars shine.
This evening—what may the evening be
That I thus [behold this goodman] (mine)?
Aye thee! aye thee!
How came [such a worthy man] to me?
- 綢繆束芻、三星在隅。
今夕何夕、見此邂逅。
子兮子兮、如此邂逅何。
    - 刍：喂牲口的青草。
    - 隅：指东南角。
    - 邂逅：即解媾，解，悦也。原意男女[和合爱悦]，这里指[志趣相投]的人。
    - Round and round the grass is bound;
And the Three Stars are [seen from the corner].
This evening is what evening,
That we have this [unexpected meeting]?
Happy pair! Happy pair!
**That we should have this unexpected meeting!**
    - (Both):
[The bundles of grass] are tied and bound,
Declining* there the Three Stars appear.
This evening—what may the evening be
That sees this [unlooked-for meeting] here
With thee? with thee!
How came it—so unforeseen—to be?
    - [* ]This is one of [the most perplexing pieces]. In the Ancient Preface [we are told that] it is [directed against the times], and that the people of Tsin thus stigmatized those who were [in exalted positions] and who [failed to show compassion to] them. But the question is, to whom is it addressed? [I cannot but agree with] [Victor von Strauss] [in his opinion that] the people are [appealing to the ruler] to [make some change in his own interests]. [There is then some sense in] the 3rd and 4th lines.

- 綢繆束楚、三星在戶。
今夕何夕、見此粲者。
子兮子兮、如此粲者何。 #pt8-99.99
    - Round and round the thorns are bound;
And the Three Stars are [seen from the door].
This evening is what evening,
That I see this [[beauty]]?
O me! O me!
That I should see a beauty like this!
    - (He):
The bundles of thorns are tied and bound,
The Three Stars [shine through the doorway there].
This evening—what may the evening be
That I thus behold this creature fair?
Aye thee! aye thee!
How came [such a creature fair] to me?
- [‡ ] Why unexpected is [a question not yet settled]. All that the [Ancient Preface] says is that the piece is directed against [the disorders of the State], and that [owing to such disorders] [it was impossible for the people to] [marry at the proper season], i.e. in the Spring.
    - [The allusion to the fuel-binding] [may have some reference to] [the bonds of wedlock]; [but it is perhaps more probable that] both this and the allusion to the Three Stars (if these are the three prominent ones in Orion, visible there in the 10th month) simply [express the season of the year], —winter.

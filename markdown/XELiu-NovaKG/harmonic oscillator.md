- In classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that, when displaced from its [[equilibrium position]], experiences a [[restoring force]] F [proportional to the displacement]([[displacement]]) x:
$${\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=-k{\vec {x}},}$$
where k is a [[positive constant]].

    - If F is the only force [acting on the system], the system is called a [[simple harmonic oscillator]], and it undergoes [[simple harmonic motion]]: [[sinusoidal oscillation]]s about the [[equilibrium point]], with a [[constant amplitude]] and a [[constant frequency]] (which does not [depend on the amplitude]).
    - If a frictional force (damping) proportional to the velocity is also present, the harmonic oscillator is described as a damped oscillator. Depending on the friction coefficient, the system can:
        - Oscillate with a frequency lower than in the undamped case, and an amplitude decreasing with time (underdamped oscillator).
        - Decay to the equilibrium position, without oscillations (overdamped oscillator).

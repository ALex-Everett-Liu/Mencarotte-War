- [[gas chromatography]]
- ---
- Chromatography is a [laboratory technique] for [the separation of a mixture]([[mixture separation]]). The mixture is [dissolved in a fluid] (gas, solvent, water, ...) called the [[mobile phase]], which carries it through a system (a column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which is fixed a material called the [[stationary phase]]. The [different constituents] of the mixture [have different affinities for] the stationary phase. The [different molecules] [stay longer or shorter on] the stationary phase, depending on their interactions with its surface sites. So, they travel at different apparent velocities in the [[mobile fluid]], causing them to separate. The separation is based on the differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary phases. Subtle differences in a [[compound]]'s [[partition coefficient]] result in [differential retention] on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation.[1]
    - Chromatography may be preparative or analytical. The purpose of [[preparative chromatography]] is to separate the components of a mixture for later use, and is thus a form of [[purification]]. [[analytical chromatography]] is done normally with [smaller amounts of material] and is for establishing the presence or measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. The two are not mutually exclusive.[2]

- The photovoltaic effect is the generation of [[voltage]] and [[electric current]] in a material [upon exposure to light]. It is a physical and [chemical phenomenon].[1]
    - The photovoltaic effect is [closely related to] the photoelectric effect. For both phenomena, [light is absorbed]([[light absorption]]), [causing excitation of an electron](((l4yF20FI3))) or other [[charge carrier]] to a [[higher-energy state]]. [The main distinction is that] the term photoelectric effect is [now usually used when] the electron is [ejected out of the material](((o2rLf40L4))) (usually into a [[vacuum]]) and photovoltaic effect used when the [excited charge carrier] is [still contained within the material]. In either case, an [[electric potential]] (or voltage) is [produced by the separation of charges], and the light has to [have a sufficient energy to] overcome the [[potential barrier]] for [[excitation]]. The [physical essence] of the difference is usually that [[photoelectric emission]] [separates the charges](((zqVngU6Ji))) by [[ballistic conduction]] 通过弹道传导分离电荷 and photovoltaic emission separates them by [[diffusion]], but some "[[hot carrier]]" [photovoltaic device] concepts [blur this distinction].

    - The first demonstration of the photovoltaic effect, by Edmond Becquerel in 1839, used an electrochemical cell. He explained his discovery in Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences, "the production of an electric current when two plates of platinum or gold immersed in an acid, neutral, or alkaline solution are exposed in an uneven way to solar radiation."[2]

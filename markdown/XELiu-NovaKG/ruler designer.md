- This article is a [Stub](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Template:Stub), **which means that it** [does not sufficiently cover](((dmsKsglQl))) its [[subject matter]]. 充分涵盖其主题 #stub
    - [Please help expand](((rAIluqgrW))) [this](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Ruler_Designer&action=edit) article if you can. 
- The Ruler Designer is a [free feature] added with [Patch 1.2]([[patch]]). It allows the [[player]] to [replace a ruler] in either [[start date]] with a customized [[starting character]], allowing [[attribute]]s, traits, [[dynasty]], and [[physical appearance]] to be tweaked.
- Appearance
    - The Ruler Designer features a [robust](((10PazBTPs))) [[character creation]] that permits [tweaking the physical appearance of the character], including [[ethnicity]], [[skin tone]], [[height]], and [[facial feature]]s. These characteristics are [passed along through] [[breeding]], and [[DNA preset]]s [can be copied or pasted].
    - The only [physical characteristic](((nD-vs3tEB))) that [can't be directly changed] through the Ruler Designer is [[body hair]] for [[male character]]s. To choose your [preferred amount of] body hair, you must [repeatedly generate a random character] until you [get the desired hairiness], and then [modify the other aspects] of his appearance as you wish. [One difficulty is that] characters [wear a gown]([[gown]]) 长袍睡衣 in the Ruler Designer, [preventing you from] determining his [[chest hair]] amount. However, you can still [judge his hairiness by] [inspecting the legs and arms]; particularly [hirsute men] 多毛的男人 will also [have a permanent stubble]([[stubble]]), 胡子茬 even when you select no [[facial hair]] option.

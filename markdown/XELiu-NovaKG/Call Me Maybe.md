- lyric
    - I threw a wish in the well 
Don’t ask me I’ll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
and now you’re in my way
I’d trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes – for a kiss
I wasn’t looking for this
But now you’re in my way
Your stare was holding / 眼神坚定
Ripped jeans – skin was showing / 牛仔裤上的破洞
Hot night – Wind was blowing
Where d’ you think you’re going baby? / 小心肝，你还能躲到哪里呢？
Hey I just met you and this is crazy
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
It’s hard to look right at you baby!
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
Hey I just met you
and this is crazy
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
and [all the other boys] [try to chase me]([[chase]]) / 想得到我
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
        - well: 许愿池
    - You took your time with the call / 尽快给我打电话吧
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you’re in my way
I beg and borrow and steal / 使出浑身解数
Have foresight, and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it’s in my way
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans – skin was showing
Hot night – Wind was blowing
Where d’ you think you’re going baby?
Hey I just met you
and this is crazy
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
It’s hard to look right at you baby!
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
Hey I just met you
and this is crazy
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
and all the other boys
try to chase me
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
    - Before you came into my life
I’ve missed you so bad
I’ve missed you so bad
I’ve missed you so so bad
Before you came into my life
I’ve missed you so bad
and You should know that
I’ve missed you so so bad

- Spectroscopy is the study of [the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation](((-cguDKDJx))) [as a function of the wavelength or frequency of the radiation](((vRfAwVlfR))).[1][2][3][4][5][6] In simpler terms, spectroscopy is the precise study of color as generalized from visible light to [all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum]([[electromagnetic spectrum]]); indeed, historically, spectroscopy originated as the study of [the wavelength dependence of the absorption] by [[gas phase matter]] of visible light [dispersed by a prism]. Matter waves and acoustic waves can also be considered forms of [[radiative energy]], and recently [[gravitational wave]]s have been associated with a [[spectral signature]] in the context of the [[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)]].

    - Spectroscopy, primarily in the electromagnetic spectrum, is a fundamental [exploratory tool] in the fields of physics, chemistry, and astronomy, allowing the composition, physical structure and [electronic structure] of matter to be investigated at the atomic, molecular and macro scale, and over astronomical distances. Important applications arise from [[biomedical spectroscopy]] in the areas of [[tissue analysis]] and [[medical imaging]].

    - An example of spectroscopy: a prism analyses white light by dispersing it into its [component colors].
- Introduction
    - Spectroscopy and [[spectrography]] are terms used to refer to the measurement of [[radiation intensity]] [as a function of wavelength](((vRfAwVlfR))) and are [often used to describe] [experimental spectroscopic methods]. [Spectral measurement devices] are referred to as [[spectrometer]]s, spectrophotometers, spectrographs or spectral analyzers.
    - [Daily observations of color] can be related to spectroscopy. [[Neon lighting]] is a direct application of [[atomic spectroscopy]]. Neon and other [[noble gas]]es have [characteristic emission frequencies (colors)]([[characteristic emission frequency]]). Neon lamps use [collision of electrons with the gas] to [excite these emissions]. Inks, dyes and paints include chemical compounds selected for their [[spectral characteristics]] in order to [generate specific colors] and hues. A commonly encountered molecular spectrum is that of nitrogen dioxide. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide has a characteristic red absorption feature, and this gives air polluted with nitrogen dioxide a reddish-brown color. Rayleigh scattering is a spectroscopic scattering phenomenon that accounts for the color of the sky.

    - Spectroscopic studies were central to the development of quantum mechanics and included Max Planck's explanation of blackbody radiation, Albert Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect and Niels Bohr's explanation of atomic structure and spectra. Spectroscopy is used in physical and analytical chemistry because atoms and molecules have unique spectra. As a result, these spectra can be used to detect, identify and quantify information about the atoms and molecules. Spectroscopy is also used in astronomy and remote sensing on Earth. Most research telescopes have spectrographs. The measured spectra are used to determine the chemical composition and physical properties of astronomical objects (such as their temperature and velocity).

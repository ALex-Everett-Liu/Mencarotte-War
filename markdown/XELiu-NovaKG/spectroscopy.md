- Spectroscopy is the study of [the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation](((-cguDKDJx))) [as a function of the wavelength or frequency of the radiation](((vRfAwVlfR))).[1][2][3][4][5][6] In simpler terms, spectroscopy is the precise study of color as generalized from visible light to [all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum]([[electromagnetic spectrum]]); indeed, historically, spectroscopy originated as the study of [the wavelength dependence of the absorption] by [[gas phase matter]] of visible light [dispersed by a prism]. Matter waves and acoustic waves can also be considered forms of [[radiative energy]], and recently [[gravitational wave]]s have been associated with a [[spectral signature]] in the context of the [[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)]].

    - Spectroscopy, primarily in the electromagnetic spectrum, is a fundamental [exploratory tool] in the fields of physics, chemistry, and astronomy, allowing the composition, physical structure and [electronic structure] of matter to be investigated at the atomic, molecular and macro scale, and over astronomical distances. Important applications arise from [[biomedical spectroscopy]] in the areas of [[tissue analysis]] and [[medical imaging]].

    - An example of spectroscopy: a prism analyses white light by dispersing it into its [component colors].
- Introduction
    - Spectroscopy and [[spectrography]] are terms used to refer to the measurement of [[radiation intensity]] [as a function of wavelength](((vRfAwVlfR))) and are [often used to describe] [experimental spectroscopic methods]. [Spectral measurement devices] are referred to as [[spectrometer]]s, spectrophotometers, spectrographs or spectral analyzers.
    - [Daily observations of color] can be related to spectroscopy. [[Neon lighting]] is a direct application of [[atomic spectroscopy]]. Neon and other [[noble gas]]es have [characteristic emission frequencies (colors)]([[characteristic emission frequency]]). Neon lamps use [collision of electrons with the gas] to [excite these emissions]. Inks, dyes and paints include chemical compounds selected for their [[spectral characteristics]] in order to [generate specific colors] and hues. A [commonly encountered] [[molecular spectrum]] is that of [[nitrogen dioxide]]. [Gaseous nitrogen dioxide] has a [characteristic red absorption feature], and this gives [air polluted with nitrogen dioxide] a [reddish-brown color]. [[Rayleigh scattering]] is a [spectroscopic scattering phenomenon] that [accounts for the color of the sky].

    - Spectroscopic studies were central to the development of quantum mechanics and included Max Planck's explanation of [[blackbody radiation]], Albert Einstein's explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] and Niels Bohr's explanation of [[atomic structure]] and [[atomic spectra]]. Spectroscopy is used in [[physical chemistry]] and [[analytical chemistry]] because atoms and molecules [have unique spectra]. As a result, these spectra can be used to detect, identify and quantify information about the atoms and molecules. Spectroscopy is also used in astronomy and [[remote sensing on Earth]]. Most [research telescopes] have [[spectrograph]]s. The [measured spectra] are used to determine the [chemical composition] and [physical properties] of [astronomical objects] (such as their temperature and velocity).

- Theory
    - One of the [central concepts] in spectroscopy is a [[resonance]] and its corresponding [[resonant frequency]]. Resonances were first characterized in [[mechanical system]]s such as [[pendulum]]s. Mechanical systems that [vibrate or oscillate] will [experience large amplitude oscillations] when they are [driven at their resonant frequency]. A plot of [[amplitude]] vs. [[excitation frequency]] will [have a peak centered at] the resonance frequency. This plot is one type of spectrum, with the peak often referred to as a [[spectral line]], and most spectral lines have a similar appearance.

    - In quantum mechanical systems, the analogous resonance is a coupling of two quantum mechanical [[stationary state]]s of one system, such as an atom, via an [[oscillatory source]] of energy such as a photon. The coupling of the two states is strongest when the energy of the source [matches the energy difference between the two states]. The energy {\displaystyle (E)}(E) of a photon is related to its frequency {\displaystyle (\nu )}(\nu ) by $$E=h\nu$$ where {\displaystyle h}h is Planck's constant, and so [a spectrum of the system response] vs. photon frequency will peak at the resonant frequency or energy. Particles such as electrons and neutrons [have a comparable relationship], the [[de Broglie relation]]s, between their kinetic energy and their wavelength and frequency and therefore can also [excite resonant interactions].

    - [Spectra of atoms and molecules] often consist of a series of spectral lines, each one representing a resonance between two different [[quantum state]]s. The explanation of these series, and the spectral patterns associated with them, were one of the experimental enigmas that drove the development and acceptance of quantum mechanics. The hydrogen spectral series in particular was first successfully explained by the Rutherford-Bohr quantum model of the hydrogen atom. In some cases spectral lines are well separated and distinguishable, but spectral lines can also overlap and appear to be a single transition if the density of energy states is high enough. Named series of lines include the principal, sharp, diffuse and fundamental series.
- History
    - Main article: History of spectroscopy
    - The history of spectroscopy began with Isaac Newton's [optics experiments] (1666–1672). According to Andrew Fraknoi and David Morrison, "In 1672, in the first paper that he submitted to the [[Royal Society]], Isaac Newton described an experiment in which he [permitted sunlight to pass through a small hole] and then through a [[prism]]. Newton found that sunlight, which looks white to us, is actually made up of [a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow]."[19] Newton applied the word "spectrum" to [describe the rainbow of colors] that [combine to form white light] and that are revealed when the [[white light]] is passed through a prism.
    - Fraknoi and Morrison state that "In 1802, William Hyde Wollaston built an improved spectrometer that included a lens to focus the Sun's spectrum on a screen. Upon use, Wollaston realized that the colors were not spread uniformly, but instead had missing patches of colors, which appeared as dark bands in the spectrum."[19] During the early 1800s, Joseph von Fraunhofer made experimental advances with dispersive spectrometers that enabled spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique. Since then, spectroscopy has played and continues to play a significant role in chemistry, physics, and astronomy. Per Fraknoi and Morrison, "Later, in 1815, German physicist Joseph Fraunhofer also examined the solar spectrum, and found about 600 such dark lines (missing colors), are now known as Fraunhofer lines, or Absorption lines."[19][better source needed]

- Yemaek or Yamaek (Korean pronunciation: [jemɛk]) was an [ancient tribal group] in the northern Korean Peninsula and Manchuria who are [regarded by some scholars as] [the ancestors of modern Koreans].[1][2] They [had ancestral ties to] the states of Gojoseon, Buyeo, Goguryeo, and tribes including Okjeo, Dongye (Ye), Yangmaek (양맥; 梁貊) and Sosumaek (소수맥; 小水貊).
    - Yemaek is believed to be a combination of Ye (濊·穢·薉) and Maek (貊·貉) people of [two neighboring cultures].[3] The [main culture] is the [Seodansan culture]([[西团山文化 (Xituanshan Culture)]]). He Qiutao (何秋涛) said Ye is the [short name] of Buyeo.[4] [Dongye]([[东濊 (Eastern Ye)]]) [first appears in history as] a [[vassal state]] of Gojoseon until its [fall to the Han dynasty] in 108 BC.[5] It was known as the Huiyetou (穢邪頭) state in [[說文解字 (Shuowen Jiezi)]].[6][7] [It later became a vassal of] the [increasingly powerful] Goguryeo. 
        - According to the Chinese Records of Three Kingdoms, Ye worshiped tigers,[8] whereas the Chinese characters 貊 (OC ZS *mɡraːɡ) & 貉 (OC *mbraːɡ), which were used to transcribe Maek, were sometimes also used to as a homophonic phonetic loan character to write 貘 (OC *mraːɡ), which means "white leopard" according to Erya;[9] yet Guo Pu's commentary indicates that 貘 means a kind of bear,[10] now identified as the giant panda since 1970s.[11] Gomnaru, the capital of Baekje, also means the "bear port". Historians suggest tigers and bears may have been totems worshiped by Ye and Maek tribes.

    - A recent study considers the ancestor of Maek (貊) to be Bal (發). According to Records of the Grand Historian, the Bal were adjacent to Shanrong and Sushen. According to Guanzi, Bal-Joseon sold patterned fur skins and visited the Royal Court. In Yi Zhou Shu, there are Ye and Bal in the book, but there are no Maek. According to this, at least Bal and Gojoseon are believed to have lived in adjacent areas.[12][13][14][15][16]
    - In 705 BC, Shanrong (山戎) carried out the plunder based on the Guzhu (孤竹國) between the Yan, Qi and Zhao kingdoms. However, it was defeated by the allied forces of the Yan and Qi of 660 BC and pushed northward. There were numerous northern peoples within the Shanrong Alliance for plunder, one of which was the Bal (發). This seems to be why Goguryeo people think they came from Guzhu (孤竹國).[17][18] After the Gojoseon–Yan War and Han conquest of Gojoseon, Bal (發) who is from north of Gojoseon is thought to move east and become a Maek family.

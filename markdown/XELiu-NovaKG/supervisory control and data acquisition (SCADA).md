- Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a [control system architecture]([[control system]]) comprising computers, [networked data communications](((9O5BOvsjc))) and [[graphical user interface (GUI)]]s for [high-level supervision of] [machines and processes]. [It also covers] [[sensor]]s and [other devices], such as [[programmable logic controller (PLC)]]s, which interface with [process plant or machinery].

- Explanation
    - The [[operator interface]]s which [enable monitoring] and [the issuing of process commands], 发出 like controller [[set point]] changes, are [handled through] the [SCADA computer system]. The [subordinated operations], 从属操作 e.g. the real-time control logic or controller calculations, are performed by networked modules connected to the field sensors and actuators.

    - The SCADA concept was developed to be a universal means of remote-access to a variety of local control modules, which could be from different manufacturers and allowing access through standard automation protocols. In practice, large SCADA systems have grown to become very similar to distributed control systems in function, while using multiple means of interfacing with the plant. They can control large-scale processes that can include multiple sites, and work over large distances as well as small distance. It is one of the most commonly-used types of industrial control systems, in spite of concerns about SCADA systems being vulnerable to cyberwarfare/cyberterrorism attacks.[citation needed]

- Plumbing is any system that [conveys fluids]([[fluid conveyance]]) [for a wide range of applications]. Plumbing uses pipes, valves, [[plumbing fixture]]s, 管道固定装置 [[tank]]s, and other [[apparatus]]es to convey fluids.[1] [Heating and cooling (HVAC)]([[heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)]]), [[waste removal]], and [[potable water delivery]] are [among the most common uses for] plumbing, [but it is not limited to] these applications.[2] [The word derives from the Latin] for lead, plumbum, as [the first effective pipes] [used in the Roman era] were [[lead pipe]]s.[3] 铅管

    - In the developed world, plumbing infrastructure is critical to [[public health]] and [[sanitation]].[4][5]
    - Boilermakers and pipefitters are not plumbers [锅炉工]和[管道安装工]不是[水管工] although they [work with piping] [as part of their trade] and their work can include some plumbing.

- Systems
    - The [major categories] of [plumbing systems] or subsystems are:[19]
        - potable cold and hot tap [[water supply]] 饮用冷热自来水供应 #[[tap water]]
        - plumbing drainage venting 管道排水通风
        - [[sewage system]]s 污水 and [[septic system]]s 化粪池; 腐败物 with or without [hot water heat recycling] and [graywater recovery and treatment systems](((WXaS_KCT5)))

        - Rainwater, surface, and subsurface water drainage
        - fuel gas piping
        - hydronics, i.e. heating and cooling systems using water to transport thermal energy, as in district heating systems, like for example the New York City steam system.
- ## Difference between pipes and tubes
    - The difference between pipes and tubes is [a matter of sizing]. For instance, PVC pipe for [plumbing applications] and [[galvanized steel pipe]] 镀锌钢管 are measured in [iron pipe size (IPS)]. Copper tube, CPVC, PeX and other tubing is measured nominally, basically an average diameter. These sizing schemes allow for universal adaptation of transitional fittings. For instance, 1/2" PeX tubing is the same size as 1/2" copper tubing. 1/2" PVC on the other hand is not the same size as 1/2" tubing, and therefore requires either a threaded male or female adapter to connect them. When used in agricultural irrigation, the singular form "pipe" is often used as a plural.[27]

- A programmable logic controller (PLC) or [[programmable controller]] is an [[industrial computer]] that [has been ruggedized and adapted for] [the control of manufacturing processes], such as [[assembly line]]s, machines, [[robotic device]]s, or [any activity that requires] high [[reliability]], ease of programming, and [[process fault diagnosis]]. Dick Morley is [considered as the father of] PLC as he had invented the first PLC, the Modicon 084, for General Motors in 1968.

    - PLCs can range from [small modular devices](((NECU0YvdC))) with tens of [inputs and outputs (I/O)]([[input/output (I/O)]]), in a [[housing]] [integral with the processor](((QePeBzMd6))), 在与处理器集成的外壳中 to [large rack-mounted modular devices](((QTarTdJx5))) [with thousands of I/O], and which are often networked to other PLC and [SCADA systems].[1]

    - They [can be designed for many arrangements of] [digital and analog I/O], extended temperature ranges, immunity to [[electrical noise]], and resistance to vibration and impact. 抗振动和冲击 Programs to control [[machine operation]] are typically stored in [[battery-backed-up]] or [[non-volatile memory]]. 
    - PLCs [were first developed in] the [automobile manufacturing industry](((6Ngexvx0I))) to provide flexible, rugged and [easily programmable controllers] to replace [hard-wired relay logic systems](((RnsHWvZye))). Since then, they [have been widely adopted as] [high-reliability automation controllers](((Tbh3YpLzO))) suitable for [[harsh environment]]s.

        - [PLCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Automate_industriel_WAGO_pour_un_syst%C3%A8me_de_monitoring_en_industrie_pharmaceutique.jpg) for a [[monitoring system]] in the [pharmaceutical industry](((YPk3Me1tq))). 
    - A PLC is an example of a "hard" [[real-time system]] since [[output result]]s [must be produced in response to] [[input condition]]s within a [[limited time]], otherwise [unintended operation] will result.

    - A PLC is an [industrial microprocessor-based controller]([[microprocessor]]) with [[programmable memory]] used to [store program instructions] and [various functions].[18] It consists of:

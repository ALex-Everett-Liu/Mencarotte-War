- Black-body radiation has a characteristic, continuous [[frequency spectrum]] that [depends only on] the body's [[temperature]],[10] called the [Planck spectrum] or [[Planck's law]]. The spectrum is peaked at a [[characteristic frequency]] that [shifts to higher frequencies]([[shift to higher frequencies]]) [with increasing temperature], and at [[room temperature]] [most of the emission]([[emission]]) is in the [[infrared region]] of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].[11][12][13] 
    - As the temperature increases past about 500 [degrees Celsius]([[degree Celsius]]), black bodies [start to emit] [significant amounts of] [[visible light]]. [Viewed in the dark] by the human eye, the first faint glow 第一道微弱的辉光 appears as a "ghostly" grey (the visible light is actually red, but [low intensity light]([[light intensity]]) activates only the eye's [[grey-level sensor]]s). With rising temperature, the glow [becomes visible] even when there is some [[background surrounding light]]: first as a [[dull red]], then yellow, and eventually a "dazzling bluish-white" [as the temperature rises].[14][15] When the body appears white, it is emitting [a substantial fraction of] its energy as [[ultraviolet radiation]]. 
    - The Sun, with an [[effective temperature]] of approximately 5800 K,[16] is [an approximate black body] with an [[emission spectrum]] [peaked in the central]([[central peak]]), yellow-green part of the [[visible spectrum]], but with [significant power] in the ultraviolet as well.
    - Black-body radiation [provides insight into] the [[thermodynamic equilibrium state]] of [[cavity radiation]].

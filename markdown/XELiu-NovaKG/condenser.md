- For condensers not involving heat transfer, see Condenser (disambiguation).
- In systems involving heat transfer, a condenser is a [[heat exchanger]] used to [condense a gaseous substance into] a [[liquid state]] through [[cooling]]. In so doing, the [[latent heat]] is [released by the substance] and transferred to the [[surrounding environment]]. Condensers are used for efficient [[heat rejection]] in many [[industrial system]]s. Condensers [can be made according to] [numerous designs], and [come in many sizes ranging from] [rather small] ([hand-held](((RVT-MB2ge)))) to [very large] ([industrial-scale units] used in [plant processes]). 工厂工艺流程 For example, a [[refrigerator]] [uses a condenser to] [get rid of heat extracted from] [the interior of the unit] [to the outside air].

    - Condensers are used in [[air conditioning]], [industrial chemical processes] such as distillation, [[steam power plant]]s and other [[heat-exchange system]]s. Use of [[cooling water]] or [[surrounding air]] as the [[coolant]] is common in many condensers.[1]

- History
    - The earliest laboratory condenser, a "Gegenstromkühler" ([counter-flow condenser]), 逆流式 was invented in 1771 by the Swedish-German chemist Christian Weigel.[2] By the mid-19th century, German chemist Justus von Liebig would provide his own improvements on the preceding designs of Weigel and Johann Friedrich August Göttling, with the device becoming known as the Liebig condenser.[3]

- 气体冷凝器
    - 冷凝器有以下几个要点：
        - ① [SO2的损失率](((c4tlfVoz0)))不能太高。因为SO2[可溶于水]，会有损失。

        - ② 温控精度。

        - ③ 使用寿命。

        - ④ 报警联锁。
其中，对于[热交换管]，HOPES 还提高了[对温度的控制]，以[保护设备][不结冰]，并有[报警连锁]的功能，使[除湿器][拥有较长的使用寿命]。

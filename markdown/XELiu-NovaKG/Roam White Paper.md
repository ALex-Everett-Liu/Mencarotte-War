- **Abstract**. Roam is [an online workspace]([[workspace]]) for [[organizing knowledge]] and [[evaluating knowledge]]. The system is built on a [[directed graph]], which [frees it from] the [[constraint]]s of the classic [[file tree]]. Users can [remix ideas](((eOg7sWzqT))) and [[connect ideas]] in [multiple overlapping hierarchies]([[overlapping hierarchy]]), with [each unit of information]([[information unit]]) becoming a [[node]] in a [[dynamic network]]. [Any given node] can occupy [[multiple positions]] simultaneously, [[convey information]] through [[defined relationship]]s, and [[populate changes]] [throughout the graph]. 
210120-02:40
    - With [weightings assigned to]([[assigned weightings]]) [the strength of relationships]([[relationship strength]]) [between nodes], Roam also [becomes a tool for] [[Bayesian inference]] and [[decision making]]. The [[ultimate goal]] is to [extend the system to] [[collaborative reasoning]], [allowing groups to] build shared [[mental map]]s and make faster and [[better-informed decision]]s.

- ## 1. [Introduction]([[introduction]])
    - [We are experiencing] [an unprecedented explosion of knowledge]([[knowledge explosion]]). Every day, 2700 books are published in the [[United States (USA)]] alone, 6850 [[scientific paper]]s are authored, more than 2 million [[blog post]]s [go live], 超过200万篇博客文章上线 and 294 billion emails [fly back and forth]. 来回飞舞 [The amount of total data] produced with [every rotation of the Earth] would fill [a stack of books] [stretching to the moon] and back.[1](((Q11MeN5ce))) While this [[exponential growth]] [presents enormous opportunities for] individuals and society at large, neither the [human brain] nor [current technologies] [are equipped to harness it] to its [[full potential]].

- ## 2. [Current approaches to] [[knowledge management]] 当下的主流知识管理方法
    - Humans are [poorly adapted to] the [[Information Age]], which has arisen only in the last ~0.02% of our [[evolutionary history]]. While the [brain] does [have a remarkable capacity]([[capability]]) for [[raw storage]], probably [in the range of] several [petabytes],[2](((LK1ttPbos))) it is infamously fallible in [processing information]([[information processing]]). 臭名昭著的易犯错误的 [[memory retrieval]] is [lossy and unreliable]([[lossy]]), while many of our hardwired [[cognitive bias]]es and [[heuristic]]s misfire in the [modern world], distorting our [[perception]], [[judgement]] and [decision-making ability]. [The plasticity of the brain]([[plasticity]]) [enables it to](((TxbHJO0kl))) [rewire itself with new connections]([[connection]]), but even this is a ‘[use it or lose it](((naPe6MUei)))’ [[feature]], causing neglected [[neural pathway]]s to atrophy. 
201120-16:53
        - atrophy: 萎缩; 衰退
misfire: 不奏效; 不起作用; 不起动; 打不着火; 不发火; 射不出子弹
        - retrieval: 取回; 索回; 数据检索
hardwired: 硬联线的，硬连线的; 基本的，固有的，无法改变的
    - Many technologies for [[organizing knowledge]] [outside of the brain] have arisen [in response to] these limitations. [Physical books and journals] proliferated after the invention of the [[Gutenberg Press]], and have since been [partially supplanted by] [[word processor]]s, [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, [[forum]]s, wikis, and [[software application]]s.
201101-22:10 
        - partially supplanted: 部分取代
plethora: 过多 ; 过量 ; 过剩
        - While [we are presented with] [a plethora of choices] for [organizing knowledge], almost every technology follows the same basic ‘[[file cabinet]]’ format: [A unit of knowledge]([[knowledge unit]]) is saved to a certain [[file path]], which [places it within] a [[taxonomy]] of [[folder]]s, [[chapter]]s or [categories]([[category]]). 
201120-17:23
        - [Tags]([[tag]]) [may be applied] when an item [relates to many things](((4VG5J1QQH))), but [each file] is generally only stored within one [[nested hierarchy]]. 
22:48 201101
        - To [[access the information]], [the user must remember] where they [stored the file](((qvPi3Bmqa))), what they [tagged it with], or use a [[search function]] to [locate it](((HyKfngC9O))).

- ## **3. Problems with the file cabinet approach** 文件柜方式的储存结构存在的问题
    - In some regards, [current technologies] [remain vastly inferior to] the human brain. If each [[neuron]] only held [a single ‘unit’ of memory]([[memory unit]]) in this manner, our brains would quickly [[fill to overflowing]]. Instead, [information is conveyed in]([[convey information]]) [the connections between neurons] and [[neural network]]s, so a [common idea] [can be made available] [across the entire brain]; the [[concept]] of a [blue sky] might be used in countless seemingly [[discrete memories]] ^^of [time spent outdoors].^^ This [[efficiency]] [helps to explain] why a [[computer]] requires [several million times] [more energy] to [perform the same tasks]([[perform the task]]) as a [[human brain]] (which runs on about [as much power as]([[power]]) a dim [light bulb]).[3](((CYya7R5M4)))
(大脑神经元以及记忆的运作方式并非是一个个单独的记忆单元的形式)
    - Unlike the brain, the [file cabinet approach] [makes it difficult or impossible to] remix or [reuse]([[reuse information]]) [the same piece of information]. Each time [a change is made to] [any given file], it has to be [tracked down]([[track down]]) and [updated in every location](((NoashHOrC))) [in which it exists]. This leads to [[redundancy]], with [a cluttering of near-identical ideas], and [[significant work]] any time a [[system-wide change]] is required. 这样做工作量极大
201123-15:58
    - [Current solutions] also lack [[interconnectivity]]. Many files are [divorced from context]([[context]]); [cast into a drawer], rather than [methodically fitted into] [a broader framework of knowledge]([[knowledge framework]]). [[knowledge tree]]s can create [pseudo-relationships] between files [nested within a given hierarchy]([[nested hierarchy]]), but these are not [[explicit relationship]], and can only describe a ‘[parent and child](((co_7HASRr)))’ [[vertical taxonomy]]. 
201123-18:17
        - Some tools, such as [[web page]]s and [[wiki]]s, also allow for [[orthogonal linking]] [between related files], but this [takes place in] an [[ad hoc fashion]], and again, [there is no ability to] [explicitly define relationships].
201123-19:01
        - divorced from context: 脱离上下文
cast into a drawer: 扔进抽屉里

- ## 9. [Conclusion]([[conclusion]])
    - The project of [[human knowledge]], as it stands today, is [a vast ocean of] ephemeral and [[fragmented information]] and ideas, much of it inaccurate, some of it [[malicious]], with the [best sources] either [restricted by gatekeepers], 门槛 or [near-impossible to locate]. [The volume of information]([[information volume]]) is [growing exponentially], which [promises enormous opportunities] if the underlying [[coordination problem]]s 潜在的协调问题 [can be resolved].
201127-23:05
        - ephemeral: 短暂的; 瞬息的
    - Clearly a fundamentally [different approach] is required. The Roam [[vision]] for [human knowledge] is a collective, [[open-source intelligence]], constantly [rearranging]([[rearrange]]), [[iterating]] and [[evolving]] in the [[pursuit of truth]].  Each of us would become a [[node]] within this [[collective intelligence]], [forging links] and [creating networks]([[network]]), [sharing the very best] [each has to offer], [improving ourselves]([[improve]]) even as we improve others, and advancing the [[interests of humanity]] [as a whole]. 促进全人类的利益

- ## About Roam
    - Roam was founded by [Conor White-Sullivan] and [Joshua Brown]. Conor [has been working on] tools for [collective intelligence] for more than nine years, founding the [online town] [common Localocracy] (acquired by AOL in 2011) then leading [[R&D]] for [[Huffington Post]] following the [[acquisition]]. 
201127-23:57
    - Conor and Josh met at [42.us.org], a [[tuition-free]] [[coding university]], where Josh [placed in the top five] of the first 1000 cadets to enter the [US program] during the [month-long application exam]. 
    - This white paper was [[co-author]]ed by [[business journalist]] [Richard Meadows], whose [[trial]] of [[early prototype]]s led him to become the [first investor]([[investor]]) in Roam.

- ### About this Paper
    - We wrote this White Paper in Winter of 2017/2018, and while [it still reflects much of our vision] for the tool, some of the features -- particularly related to [[Bayesian reasoning]], [[argument analysis]], and [[prediction market]]s we found to be in-fact much [lower priority]([[low priority]]) for the [[researcher]]s and [decision makers]([[decision making]]) whose thinking [we aim to assist] -- and risked [making the tool too complex] for the more significant [[use case]]s.  If you are interested in using Roam for more formal [[quantitative reasoning]] or building out [[formal model]]s of [[belief network]]s, __or if you are [excited about ideas] in this paper which you [do not see a way to do] currently within Roam, please [contact us].__

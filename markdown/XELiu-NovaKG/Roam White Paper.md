- **Abstract**. Roam is [an online workspace]([[workspace]]) for [[organizing knowledge]] and [[evaluating knowledge]]. The system is built on a [[directed graph]], which [frees it from] the [[constraint]]s of the classic [[file tree]]. Users can [[remix ideas]] and [[connect ideas]] in multiple [[overlapping hierarchies]], with [each unit of information]([[information unit]]) becoming a [[node]] in a [[dynamic network]]. [Any given node] can occupy [[multiple positions]] simultaneously, [[convey information]] through [[defined relationship]]s, and [[populate changes]] [throughout the graph].

    - With [weightings assigned to]([[assigned weightings]]) [the strength of relationships]([[relationship strength]]) [between nodes], Roam also [becomes a tool for] [[Bayesian inference]] and [[decision making]]. The [[ultimate goal]] is to [extend the system to] [[collaborative reasoning]], [allowing groups to] build shared [[mental map]]s and make faster and [[better-informed decision]]s.

- ## 1. [Introduction]([[introduction]])
    - [We are experiencing] [an unprecedented explosion of knowledge]([[knowledge explosion]]). Every day, 2700 books are published in the [[United States (USA)]] alone, 6850 [[scientific paper]]s are authored, more than 2 million [[blog post]]s [go live], 超过200万篇博客文章上线 and 294 billion emails [fly back and forth]. 来回飞舞 [The amount of total data] produced with [every rotation of the Earth] would fill [a stack of books] [stretching to the moon] and back.[1](((Q11MeN5ce))) While this [[exponential growth]] [presents enormous opportunities for] individuals and society at large, neither the [[human brain]] nor [current technologies] [are equipped to harness it] to its [[full potential]].

    - Humans are [poorly adapted to] the [[Information Age]], which has arisen only in the last ~0.02% of our [[evolutionary history]]. While the [brain] does [have a remarkable capacity]([[capability]]) for [[raw storage]], probably [in the range of] several [petabytes],[2](((LK1ttPbos))) it is infamously fallible in [processing information]([[information processing]]). [[memory retrieval]] is [lossy and unreliable]([[lossy]]), while many of our hardwired [[cognitive bias]]es and [[heuristic]]s misfire in the [modern world], distorting our [[perception]], [[judgement]] and [decision-making ability]. [The plasticity of the brain]([[plasticity]]) enables it to [rewire itself with new connections]([[connection]]), but even this is a ‘[[use it or lose it]]’ [[feature]], causing neglected [[neural pathway]]s to atrophy. 
201120-16:53
        - atrophy: 萎缩; 衰退
misfire: 不奏效; 不起作用; 不起动; 打不着火; 不发火; 射不出子弹
        - retrieval: 取回; 索回; 数据检索
hardwired: 硬联线的，硬连线的; 基本的，固有的，无法改变的
    - Many technologies for [[organizing knowledge]] [outside of the brain] have arisen [in response to] these limitations. [Physical books and journals] proliferated after the invention of the [[Gutenberg Press]], and have since been [partially supplanted by] [[word processor]]s, [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, [[forum]]s, [[wiki]]s, and [[software application]]s.
201101-22:10 
        - partially supplanted: 部分取代
plethora: 过多 ; 过量 ; 过剩
        - While [we are presented with] [a plethora of choices] for [organizing knowledge], almost every technology follows the same basic ‘[[file cabinet]]’ format: [A unit of knowledge]([[knowledge unit]]) is saved to a certain [[file path]], which [places it within] a [[taxonomy]] of [[folder]]s, [[chapter]]s or [categories]([[category]]). 
201120-17:23
        - [Tags]([[tag]]) [may be applied] when an item [relates to many things]([[multiple relationships]]), but [each file] is generally only stored within one [[nested hierarchy]]. 
22:48 201101
        - To [[access the information]], [the user must remember] where they [stored the file]([[store files]]), what they [tagged it with], or use a [[search function]] to [[locate]] it.

- **Abstract**. Roam is [an online workspace]([[workspace]]) for [[organizing knowledge]] and [[evaluating knowledge]]. The system is built on a [[directed graph]], which [frees it from] the [[constraint]]s of the classic [[file tree]]. Users can [[remix ideas]] and [[connect ideas]] in multiple [[overlapping hierarchies]], with [each unit of information]([[information unit]]) becoming a [[node]] in a [[dynamic network]]. [Any given node] can occupy [[multiple positions]] simultaneously, [[convey information]] through [[defined relationship]]s, and [[populate changes]] [throughout the graph].

    - With [weightings assigned to]([[assigned weightings]]) [the strength of relationships]([[relationship strength]]) [between nodes], Roam also [becomes a tool for] [[Bayesian inference]] and [[decision making]]. The [[ultimate goal]] is to [extend the system to] [[collaborative reasoning]], [allowing groups to] build shared [[mental map]]s and make faster and [[better-informed decision]]s.

    - [We are experiencing] [an unprecedented explosion of knowledge]([[knowledge explosion]]). Every day, 2700 books are published in the [[United States (USA)]] alone, 6850 [[scientific paper]]s are authored, more than 2 million [[blog post]]s [go live], 超过200万篇博客文章上线 and 294 billion emails [fly back and forth]. 来回飞舞 [The amount of total data] produced with [every rotation of the Earth] would fill [a stack of books] [stretching to the moon] and back.[1](((Q11MeN5ce))) While this [[exponential growth]] [presents enormous opportunities for] individuals and society at large, neither the [[human brain]] nor [current technologies] [are equipped to harness it] to its [[full potential]].

- Before I created [[Piggydb]], I had been using a Wiki for [storing and organizing my thoughts], ideas, article excerpts, and anything else I wanted to write down. Although a wiki provides [an extremely simple and flexible way to] [organize your knowledge] in a [network structure], [I came to feel that] [it was not well suited for] [what I wanted to do]. As I used it more extensively, I found that the [[data structure]] of a [[wiki]] [was not flexible enough] when I want to [reuse some part of a page](((gWW-wxwvS))) [in different context]([[context]]).

    - Another drawback of a wiki, for me, is that [it encourages you to] organize your knowledge [in a top-down manner]([[top-down approach]]), that is, you have to select a [[main theme]] as a [[starting point]]. But I wanted to [write down anything I thought could be useful] and [organize afterward], as needed.
    - So I decided to [create a software program] to [meet my needs]. [The first concept was that] [users can input] [finer grained units of information]([[information unit]]) 更细粒度的信息单元 (which I call “[[knowledge fragment]]s”) and [organize them more freely] and flexibly. Also, since knowledge fragments [can be classified using tags]([[tag]]), I thought [it would lead to] [a more powerful tool for] [[knowledge management]] while [retaining the simplicity of a wiki] or other [notebook applications]. #[[fine grained]]

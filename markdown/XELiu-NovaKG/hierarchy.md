- A **hierarchy** (from the [[Ancient Greek]]: ἱεραρχία, __hierarkhia__, 'rule of a [[high priest]]', 大祭司 from __[hierarkhes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_(officer))__, 'president of [[sacred rite]]s')  is an [[arrangement]] of items (objects, names, values, [[categories]], etc.) in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the [[same level]] as" one another. Hierarchy is [an important concept] [in a wide variety of fields], such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, [[organizational theory]], [[systems theory]], [[systematic biology]], and the [[social science]]s (especially [[political philosophy]]).
    - A hierarchy can [link entities] [either directly or indirectly], and either vertically or [diagonally]([[diagonal link]]). The only [[direct link]]s in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's [[immediate superior]] or to one of one's [[subordinate]]s, although a system that is [largely hierarchical] can also incorporate [[alternative hierarchies]]. 合并[替代层次结构] [Hierarchical links]([[hierarchical link]]) can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via [multiple links in the same direction], following a [[path]]. 
        - All parts of the hierarchy that are not [linked vertically to one another]([[vertical link]]) nevertheless [can be "horizontally" linked] through a path by [traveling up the hierarchy] to find a common direct or [indirect superior]([[common superior]]), and then down again. This is akin to two [[co-worker]]s or [[colleague]]s ([[employment]]); each [reports to a common superior], but they have the same [relative amount] of [[authority]]. [Organizational forms]([[organizational form]]) exist that are both alternative and [[complementary]] to hierarchy. 替代和补充 [Heterarchy]([[heterarchy]]) is [one such form].

    - Hierarchies have their own [special vocabulary]([[vocabulary]]). These terms are [easiest to understand when] a hierarchy is [[diagrammed]] (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy#Visualization)). #visualization 
    - In an [[organizational context]], [the following terms] are often used related to hierarchies:[1][2]
        - Object: one entity (e.g., a person, department or concept or element of arrangement or [member of a set]) #[[non-physical entity]]
        - System: [the entire set of objects] that are [being arranged hierarchically] (e.g., an [[administration]])
    - ### [[degree of branching]]
        - Degree of branching refers to the number of [direct subordinates or children] an object has (in graph theory, equivalent to the number of other [[vertices]] connected to via [[outgoing arc]]s, 通过输出弧连接到的其他顶点 in a directed graph) a [[node]] has. Hierarchies can be categorized based on the "[[maximum degree]]", the highest degree present in the system as a whole. [[categorization]] in this way [yields two broad classes]: __linear__ and __branching__. #[[bifurcation theory]]
        - In a [[linear hierarchy]], the maximum degree is 1.[1] In other words, [all of the objects] [can be visualized in a line-up], and each object (excluding [the top and bottom ones]) has exactly one [[direct subordinate]] and one [[direct superior]]. Note that this is referring to the objects and not the levels; every hierarchy has this property with respect to levels, but normally each level can have an [infinite number of objects]. An example of a linear hierarchy is [the hierarchy of life]([[life hierarchy]]). #[[biological organization]]
        - An [[overlapping hierarchy]] is a [[branching hierarchy]] in which at least one object [has two parent objects]([[parent object]]).[1] For example, a [[graduate student]] can have two [[co-supervisor]]s to whom the student [reports directly] and equally, and who [have the same level of authority] within the [[university hierarchy]] (i.e., they have the same [position]([[academic rank]]) or [[tenure status]]).
- ## [Etymology]([[etymology]])
    - Possibly the first use of the English word hierarchy cited by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] was in 1881, when it was [used in reference to] [the three orders of three angels] as depicted by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (5th–6th centuries). 雅典最高法官 Pseudo-Dionysius used the [related Greek word] (ἱεραρχία, __hierarchia__) both in reference to the [[celestial hierarchy]] and the [[ecclesiastical hierarchy]].[3] The Greek term hierarchia means 'rule of a high priest',[4] from hierarches (ἱεράρχης, 'president of sacred rites, high-priest')[5] and that from hiereus (ἱερεύς, 'priest')[6] and arche (ἀρχή, '[first place] or power, rule').[7] Dionysius is [credited with first use of it] as an [[abstract noun]].
    - Since hierarchical churches, such as the Roman Catholic (see Catholic Church hierarchy) and Eastern Orthodox churches, had tables of organization that were "hierarchical" in the modern sense of the word (traditionally with God as the pinnacle or head of the hierarchy), the term came to refer to similar organizational methods in secular settings.

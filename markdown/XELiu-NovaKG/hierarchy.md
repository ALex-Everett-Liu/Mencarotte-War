- A **hierarchy** (from the [[Ancient Greek]]: ἱεραρχία, __hierarkhia__, 'rule of a [[high priest]]', 大祭司 from __[hierarkhes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_(officer))__, 'president of [[sacred rite]]s')  is an [[arrangement]] of items (objects, names, values, [[categories]], etc.) in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the [[same level]] as" one another. Hierarchy is [an important concept] [in a wide variety of fields], such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, [[organizational theory]], [[systems theory]], [[systematic biology]], and the [[social science]]s (especially [[political philosophy]]).
    - A hierarchy can [link entities] [either directly or indirectly], and either vertically or [diagonally]([[diagonal link]]). The only [[direct link]]s in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's [[immediate superior]] or to one of one's [[subordinate]]s, although a system that is [largely hierarchical] can also incorporate [[alternative hierarchies]]. 合并[替代层次结构] [Hierarchical links]([[hierarchical link]]) can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via [multiple links in the same direction], following a [[path]]. 
        - All parts of the hierarchy that are not [linked vertically to one another]([[vertical link]]) nevertheless [can be "horizontally" linked] through a path by [traveling up the hierarchy] to find a common direct or [indirect superior]([[common superior]]), and then down again. This is akin to two [[co-worker]]s or [[colleague]]s ([[employment]]); each [reports to a common superior], but they have the same [relative amount] of [[authority]]. [Organizational forms]([[organizational form]]) exist that are both alternative and [[complementary]] to hierarchy. 替代和补充 [Heterarchy]([[heterarchy]]) is [one such form].

    - Hierarchies have their own [special vocabulary]([[vocabulary]]). These terms are [easiest to understand when] a hierarchy is [[diagrammed]] (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy#Visualization)). #visualization 
    - In an [[organizational context]], [the following terms] are often used related to hierarchies:[1][2]
        - Object: one entity (e.g., a person, department or concept or element of arrangement or [member of a set]) #[[non-physical entity]]
        - System: [the entire set of objects] that are [being arranged hierarchically] (e.g., an [[administration]])
    - ### [[degree of branching]]
        - Degree of branching refers to the number of [direct subordinates or children] an object has (in graph theory, equivalent to the number of other [[vertices]] connected to via [[outgoing arc]]s, 通过输出弧连接到的其他顶点 in a directed graph) a [[node]] has. Hierarchies can be categorized based on the "[[maximum degree]]", the highest degree present in the system as a whole. [[categorization]] in this way [yields two broad classes]: __linear__ and __branching__. #[[bifurcation theory]]
        - In a [[linear hierarchy]], the maximum degree is 1.[1] In other words, [all of the objects] [can be visualized in a line-up], and each object (excluding [the top and bottom ones]) has exactly one [[direct subordinate]] and one [[direct superior]]. Note that this is referring to the objects and not the levels; every hierarchy has this property with respect to levels, but normally each level can have an [infinite number of objects]. An example of a linear hierarchy is [the hierarchy of life]([[life hierarchy]]). #[[biological organization]]
        - An [[overlapping hierarchy]] is a [[branching hierarchy]] in which at least one object [has two parent objects]([[parent object]]).[1] For example, a [[graduate student]] can have two [[co-supervisor]]s to whom the student [reports directly] and equally, and who [have the same level of authority] within the [[university hierarchy]] (i.e., they have the same [position]([[academic rank]]) or [[tenure status]]).
- ## [Etymology]([[etymology]])
    - Possibly the first use of the English word hierarchy cited by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] was in 1881, when it was [used in reference to] [the three orders of three angels] as depicted by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (5th–6th centuries). 雅典最高法官 Pseudo-Dionysius used the [related Greek word] (ἱεραρχία, __hierarchia__) both in reference to the [[celestial hierarchy]] and the [[ecclesiastical hierarchy]].[3] The Greek term hierarchia means 'rule of a high priest',[4] from hierarches (ἱεράρχης, 'president of sacred rites, high-priest')[5] and that from hiereus (ἱερεύς, 'priest')[6] and arche (ἀρχή, '[first place] or power, rule').[7] Dionysius is [credited with first use of it] as an [[abstract noun]].
    - Since [[hierarchical church]]es, such as the [[Roman Catholic]] (see [[Catholic Church hierarchy]]) and [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, had [tables of organization] that were "hierarchical" [in the modern sense of the word] (traditionally with God as [the pinnacle or head of the hierarchy]), the term [came to refer to] similar [organizational methods] in [[secular settings]].

- ## Representing hierarchies
    - A hierarchy is [typically depicted as] a [[pyramid]], where [the height of a level] represents that [level's status]([[level status]]) and [width of a level]([[level width]]) represents [the quantity of items] at that level [relative to the whole].[8] For example, [the few Directors of a company]([[board of directors]]) could be [at the apex]([[apex]]), and the [[base]] could be [thousands of people] who [have no subordinates].
    - These pyramids are often diagrammed with a triangle diagram which serves to emphasize the size differences between the levels (but note that not all triangle/pyramid diagrams are hierarchical; for example, the 1992 USDA food guide pyramid). An example of a triangle diagram appears to the right.
    - Another common representation of a hierarchical scheme is as a tree diagram. Phylogenetic trees, charts showing the structure of § organizations, and playoff brackets in sports are often illustrated this way.
    - More recently, as computers have allowed the storage and navigation of ever larger data sets, various methods have been developed to represent hierarchies in a manner that makes more efficient use of the available space on a computer's screen. Examples include fractal maps, TreeMaps and Radial Trees.

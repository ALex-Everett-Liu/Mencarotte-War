- A **hierarchy** (from the [[Ancient Greek]]: ἱεραρχία, __hierarkhia__, 'rule of a [[high priest]]', 大祭司 from __[hierarkhes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_(officer))__, 'president of [[sacred rite]]s')  is an [[arrangement]] of items (objects, names, values, [[categories]], etc.) in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the [[same level]] as" one another. Hierarchy is [an important concept] [in a wide variety of fields], such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, [[organizational theory]], [[systems theory]], [[systematic biology]], and the [[social science]]s (especially [[political philosophy]]).
    - A hierarchy can [link entities] [either directly or indirectly], and either vertically or [diagonally]([[diagonal link]]). The only [[direct link]]s in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's [[immediate superior]] or to one of one's [[subordinate]]s, although a system that is [largely hierarchical] can also incorporate [[alternative hierarchies]]. 合并[替代层次结构] [Hierarchical links]([[hierarchical link]]) can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via [multiple links in the same direction], following a [[path]]. 
        - All parts of the hierarchy that are not [linked vertically to one another]([[vertical link]]) nevertheless [can be "horizontally" linked] through a path by [traveling up the hierarchy] to find a common direct or [indirect superior]([[common superior]]), and then down again. This is akin to two [[co-worker]]s or [[colleague]]s ([[employment]]); each [reports to a common superior], but they have the same [relative amount] of [[authority]]. [Organizational forms]([[organizational form]]) exist that are both alternative and [[complementary]] to hierarchy. 替代和补充 [Heterarchy]([[heterarchy]]) is [one such form].

    - Hierarchies have their own [special vocabulary]([[vocabulary]]). These terms are [easiest to understand when] a hierarchy is [[diagrammed]] (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy#Visualization)). #visualization 
    - In an [[organizational context]], [the following terms] are often used related to hierarchies:[1][2]
        - Object: one entity (e.g., a person, department or concept or element of arrangement or [member of a set]) #[[non-physical entity]]
        - System: [the entire set of objects] that are [being arranged hierarchically] (e.g., an [[administration]])
    - ### Degree of branching
        - Degree of branching refers to the number of direct subordinates or children an object has (in graph theory, equivalent to the number of other vertices connected to via outgoing arcs, in a directed graph) a node has. Hierarchies can be categorized based on the "maximum degree", the highest degree present in the system as a whole. Categorization in this way yields two broad classes: __linear__ and __branching__.
        - In a linear hierarchy, the maximum degree is 1.[1] In other words, all of the objects can be visualized in a line-up, and each object (excluding the top and bottom ones) has exactly one direct subordinate and one direct superior. Note that this is referring to the objects and not the levels; every hierarchy has this property with respect to levels, but normally each level can have an infinite number of objects. An example of a linear hierarchy is the hierarchy of life.
        - An [[overlapping hierarchy]] is a branching hierarchy in which at least one object has two parent objects.[1] For example, a graduate student can have two co-supervisors to whom the student reports directly and equally, and who have the same level of authority within the university hierarchy (i.e., they have the same position or tenure status).

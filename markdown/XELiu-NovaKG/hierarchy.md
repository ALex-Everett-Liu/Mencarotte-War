- A **hierarchy** (from the [[Ancient Greek]]: ἱεραρχία, __hierarkhia__, 'rule of a [[high priest]]', 大祭司 from __[hierarkhes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_(officer))__, 'president of [[sacred rite]]s')  is an [[arrangement]] of items (objects, names, values, [[categories]], etc.) in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the [[same level]] as" one another. Hierarchy is [an important concept] [in a wide variety of fields], such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, [[organizational theory]], [[systems theory]], [[systematic biology]], and the [[social science]]s (especially [[political philosophy]]).
    - A hierarchy can [link entities] [either directly or indirectly], and either vertically or [diagonally]([[diagonal link]]). The only [[direct link]]s in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's [[immediate superior]] or to one of one's [[subordinate]]s, although a system that is [largely hierarchical] can also incorporate [[alternative hierarchies]]. 合并替代层次结构 [Hierarchical links]([[hierarchical link]]) can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via [multiple links in the same direction], following a [[path]]. All parts of the hierarchy that are not [linked vertically to one another]([[vertical link]]) nevertheless [can be "horizontally" linked] through a path by [traveling up the hierarchy] to find a common direct or [indirect superior]([[common superior]]), and then down again. This is akin to two co-workers or colleagues; each reports to a common superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority. Organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy. Heterarchy is one such form.

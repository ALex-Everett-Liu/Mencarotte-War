- Background and Rise to power
    - Dae Yeon-rim was a descendant of the [Balhae Royal family] as the [7th-generation direct descendant] of [[大祚榮 (Dae Joyeong)]], who was the founder of Balhae. He entered the Liao army at an unknown age and was eventually assigned to the central province as a general. While serving as a general of the Liao Dynasty, Dae Yeon-rim secretly dreamed of re-establishing the glories of the former kingdom of Balhae, and began gathering people of Balhae origin, and eventually established the kingdom of Heung-yo during the year 1029 AD. The kingdom of Heung-yo gathered the attention of numerous Balhae people, and flourished until 1030 AD, when the Liao sent an army to conquer and destroy the kingdom.

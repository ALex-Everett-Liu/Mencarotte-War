- A distributed control system (DCS) is a [computerised control system]([[control system]]) [for a process or plant] usually with many [[control loop]]s, in which [autonomous controllers](((b5n_4wCn8))) are [distributed throughout the system], but there is no [central operator supervisory control]([[supervisory control]]). 中央操作员 [This is in contrast to systems that] use [centralized controllers](((lYwxlTOnQ))); either [discrete controllers](((hUjKMBTVR))) located at a [[central control room]] or within a [[central computer]]. The DCS concept increases [[reliability]] and reduces [[installation cost]]s by [localising control functions] near the [[process plant]], with [[remote monitoring]] and supervision.

    - Distributed control systems [first emerged in] large, high value, [safety critical] [process industries]([[process industry]]), and were attractive because the [DCS manufacturer] [would supply both] the [local control level](((HKv1q9AxM))) and [central supervisory equipment] [as an integrated package], thus reducing design integration risk. Today the functionality of SCADA and DCS systems are very similar, but DCS tends to be used on large continuous process plants where high reliability and security is important, and the control room is not geographically remote.

- A distributed control system (DCS) is a [computerised control system]([[control system]]) [for a process or plant] usually with many [[control loop]]s, in which [autonomous controllers](((b5n_4wCn8))) are [distributed throughout the system], but there is no [central operator supervisory control]([[supervisory control]]). 中央操作员 [This is in contrast to systems that] use [centralized controllers](((lYwxlTOnQ))); either [discrete controllers](((hUjKMBTVR))) located at a [[central control room]] or within a [[central computer]]. The DCS concept increases [[reliability]] and reduces [[installation cost]]s by [localising control functions] near the [[process plant]], with [[remote monitoring]] and supervision.

    - Distributed control systems [first emerged in] large, high value, [safety critical] [process industries]([[process industry]]), and were attractive because the [DCS manufacturer] [would supply both] the [local control level](((HKv1q9AxM))) and [central supervisory equipment](((m_3pe-wXU))) [as an integrated package], thus reducing [design integration risk]. Today the [[functionality]] of [[supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)]] and DCS systems are very similar, but DCS tends to be used on large continuous process plants where high [[reliability]] and [[security]] is important, and the [control room]([[central control room]]) is not [geographically remote].

- Structure
    - The [key attribute] of a DCS is its [[reliability]] due to [the distribution of the control processing] [around nodes in the system]. This [mitigates](((cP_NawHwn))) [a single processor failure]([[processor]]). If a processor fails, it will [only affect one section of] the [plant process], [as opposed to a failure of] a [[central computer]] which would [affect the whole process]. [This distribution of computing power local to]([[computing power]]) the [field Input/Output (I/O) connection racks]([[input/output (I/O)]]) 现场I/O连接机架 also ensures [fast controller processing times] by removing possible [[network delay]] and [central processing delays].

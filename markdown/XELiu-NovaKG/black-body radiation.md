- Abstract
    - Black-body radiation is the [[thermal electromagnetic radiation]] [within or surrounding a body] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its [[environment]], emitted by a [[black body]] (an [[idealized]] [[opaque]], [[non-reflective body]]). It has [a specific spectrum of wavelengths], [inversely related to] [[intensity]] that [depend only on] the body's [[temperature]], which is [assumed for the sake of calculations] and theory to be [[uniform]] and constant. [1](((wB1tjZ97o))) [2](((YtDlStw5V))) [3] [4]
        The [[thermal radiation]] [spontaneously emitted by] many [[ordinary object]]s [can be approximated as] black-body radiation. A perfectly [[insulated enclosure]] 绝热外壳 that is in [thermal equilibrium internally]([[thermal equilibrium]]) [contains black-body radiation] and will [[emit]] it through a [[hole]] [made in its wall], provided the hole is [small enough] to have a [[negligible effect]] upon the equilibrium.
        In a [[dark room]], a black body at [[room temperature]] [appears black] because [most of the energy] it radiates is in the [[infrared spectrum]] and cannot be perceived by the [[human eye]]. Since the human eye cannot [[perceive light waves]] below the [[visible frequency]], a black body at the lowest just faintly visible temperature 只是微弱可见的 [subjectively appears grey], even though its [objective physical spectrum peak] is in the [[infrared range]].[5] The human eye essentially does not [perceive color] [at low light levels]. When the object [becomes a little hotter], it appears dull red. As its temperature [increases further] it becomes [[bright red]], orange, yellow, white, and ultimately [[blue-white]].
        Although [[planet]]s and [[star]]s are neither [in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings] nor [perfect black bodies], black-body radiation is used as a [[first approximation]] for [the energy they emit]([[emit energy]]).[6] [Black holes]([[black hole]]) are [near-perfect black bodies], [in the sense that] they [absorb all the radiation]([[absorb the radiation]]) that falls on them. It has been proposed that they [emit black-body radiation] (called [[Hawking radiation]]), [with a temperature] that depends on the [[mass]] of the black hole.[7]
    - The term __black body__ was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860.[8] Black-body radiation is also called thermal radiation, __cavity radiation__, __complete radiation__ or __temperature radiation__.
    - The color ([[chromaticity]]) of [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PlanckianLocus.png) [scales inversely with]([[scale inversely]]) the temperature of the black body; 与温度成反比 the locus of such colors, shown here in [CIE 1931 x,y space]([[CIE 1931 color space]]), is known as the [[Planckian locus]].

        CIE xy 1931 [chromaticity diagram] including the Planckian Locus. The Planckian locus is the path that a [black body color] will [take through the diagram] [as the black body temperature changes]. [Lines crossing the locus] indicate lines of [constant correlated] [[color temperature]]. 恒定相关色温 [Monochromatic wavelengths]([[monochromatic wavelength]]) are [shown in blue] [in units of nanometers]([[nanometer]]). Latest version (16 April 2005) uses [1931 CIE standard observer], since this is the [most commonly used] [[standard observer]].

This has [several advantages]; see [Commons:Media for cleanup](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Media_for_cleanup#PNG_or_JPEG_images_that_should_be_SVG) [for more information].

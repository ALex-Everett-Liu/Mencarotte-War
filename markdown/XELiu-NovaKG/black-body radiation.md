- Black-body radiation is the [[thermal electromagnetic radiation]] [within or surrounding a body] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its environment, emitted by a [[black body]] (an idealized [[opaque]], [non-reflective body](). It has [a specific spectrum of wavelengths], [inversely related to] [[intensity]] that [depend only on] the body's [[temperature]], which is [assumed for the sake of calculations] and theory to be [uniform and constant].

- Black-body radiation is the [[thermal electromagnetic radiation]] [within or surrounding a body] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its environment, emitted by a [[black body]] (an idealized [[opaque]], [non-reflective body](). It has [a specific spectrum of wavelengths], [inversely related to] [[intensity]] that [depend only on] the body's [[temperature]], which is [assumed for the sake of calculations] and theory to be [uniform and constant].

    - The [[thermal radiation]] [spontaneously emitted by] many [[ordinary object]]s [can be approximated as] black-body radiation. A perfectly [[insulated enclosure]] 绝热外壳 that is in [thermal equilibrium internally]([[thermal equilibrium]]) [contains black-body radiation] and will [emit it through a hole] [made in its wall], provided the hole is [small enough] to have a [negligible effect] upon the equilibrium.

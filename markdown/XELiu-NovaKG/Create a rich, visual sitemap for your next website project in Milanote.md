- In this guide you'll learn to create a rich, visual [[sitemap]] to [inform a website design project]. Our goal is to [create the perfect combination of] [content and structure], setting out both [the hierarchy of pages](((RKP_Chh6M))) and also [what will live on those pages]. This task is usually [completed by multiple people], [each responsible for] [different elements of the website]. While [[designer]]s and [[marketer]]s are [thinking about navigation and content], the [[developer]]s are [figuring out how they will finally built it]. [It's a good idea to] invite [the rest of your team] to [help you out]. We'll guide you through this process in Milanote -Â [Get started for free](https://www.milanote.com/register).

- ### Start at the top
    - Our [visual sitemap] needs to [achieve two main objectives]. First, to [provide a birds-eye view of](((UOSaGH9z8))) the [website structure], [[page hierarchy]] and [[categorisation]]. Second, to [provide guidance on the content] for each page. We're going to [produce a visual sitemap] that [tackles both of these challenges], using [Milanote boards] to [represent each page]. Boards [work like folders]([[folder]]) and we'll [place content inside them later].

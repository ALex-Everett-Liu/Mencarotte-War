- In this guide you'll learn to create a rich, visual [[sitemap]] to [inform a website design project]. Our goal is to [create the perfect combination of] [content and structure], setting out both [the hierarchy of pages](((RKP_Chh6M))) and also [what will live on those pages]. This task is usually [completed by multiple people], [each responsible for] [different elements of the website]. While [[designer]]s and [[marketer]]s are [thinking about navigation and content], the [[developer]]s are [figuring out how they will finally built it]. [It's a good idea to] invite [the rest of your team] to [help you out]. We'll guide you through this process in Milanote - [Get started for free](https://www.milanote.com/register).

- ### Start at the top
    - Our [visual sitemap] needs to [achieve two main objectives]. First, to [provide a birds-eye view of](((UOSaGH9z8))) the [website structure], [[page hierarchy]] and [[categorisation]]. Second, to [provide guidance on the content] for each page. We're going to [produce a visual sitemap] that [tackles both of these challenges], using [Milanote boards] to [represent each page]. Boards [work like folders]([[folder]]) and we'll [place content inside them later].
    - Begin by dragging a new **Board** in from the [[toolbar]].
    - Name the **Board** ['Homepage'](((REvD1KmmF))).
    - Milanote will [automatically generate an icon](((lPu7McexT))) for the board, but [you can change this if you wish]. #icon
- ### Create top level page boards
    - Next up are the [top-level pages](https://www.paldesk.com/create-landing-page). We're going to use boards for these too, and indicate [internal linking]([[internal link]]) by [connecting them with lines]. [You may not be sure] [how many pages you need] [at this stage]. This is fine! It's important to [remain open minded] and [allow the structure to emerge gradually](((ADzm56gx-))) [as you discover more about] [what will exist within the pages].

    - Create your [first top-level page](((cjOHKVBiy))) by dragging in a new **Board** from the toolbar.
    - Give the **Board** a name.
    - [Connect your pages] by selecting both **Boards**, [right-clicking], and selecting ['Connect with Lines'](((6UCYtK1ZB))).
    - [Repeat this for each top-level page] [you wish to create].
- ### Create sub-pages
    - Next we're going to create the [[sub-page]]s that [live deeper within the website]. For larger websites, you can [group large sections together] to be [represented by one board].

    - Drag in new **Boards** [for each sub page].
    - [Connect these with lines] [as you did previously].

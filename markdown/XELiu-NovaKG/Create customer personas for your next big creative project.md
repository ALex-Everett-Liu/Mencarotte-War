- [In this guide](https://milanote.com/guide/personas?referrer=rcCO3ehGRWkqTf3QEE) you'll learn to create [[customer persona]]s—fictional, [composite characters] that [represent a key segment of your audience]. We believe that the best personas are more than just [static PDFs]. They should [grow and evolve naturally] [as you learn more about] your customers. With Milanote, you can continue to [update your personas] over time, and can easily [share the boards with clients] and your team for feedback.

- ### [Gather existing data] on your customers
    - [Collecting information about your audience] is the first step in [creating a persona]. There are usually many [good sources of information]([[information source]]) available, from [the data that's housed in] your [website analytics suite](((JC-azSbGz))) 网站分析套件 to [real-life conversations with customers]. 真实对话 [It really helps to] [spend some time] [gathering together the most relevant data] that you have access to, and to spend some time [preparing it for discussion] with your team. Anyone who [interacts with customers] or [customer data](((RHTgaXv9K))) should be involved in [sharing their perspective on] [what makes your customers tick].

    - Drag a new **Board** in [from the toolbar] and title it "Persona Research" [or something similar].

    - Open the **Board** you created and [start compiling your research].
    - Drag in a **Note** from the toolbar [for each piece of content] (or [double-click the canvas] to create a new **Note**).
    - You can also [drag in any useful files], such as PDFs, spreadsheets, images, etc.
- ### Interview customers to fill in the gaps
    - After spending time [sorting through your research], 整理你的研究 you'll probably [become aware of] [the gaps in the information you have access to]. It's time to start [having real conversations]—after all, who knows your customers better than themselves? [[survey]]s and [[interview]]s are often [a critical component of] [building useful personas]. Simple tools like [Typeform](https://typeform.com/?utm_source=Milanote&utm_medium=referral) and [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/?utm_source=Milanote&utm_medium=referral) can help you to [capture survey responses](https://www.nextiva.com/blog/survey-best-practices.html) relatively quickly, while [interviewing customers] [either in person or over the phone] will help you to really [dive into the details].

    - Drag a new **Board** in from the toolbar and title it "Interviews" or something similar. This is [where your planning will take place].
    - Drag in a **Note** from the toolbar and enter each group of [interview questions] as **Bullet** list items. #[[bullet list]]
    - Drag in a **To-do **list to [help prepare the rest of] the [interview sessions]. #[[to-do list]]
- ### Decide how many personas are necessary
    - Once you've gathered all of your research together, you should start to see some common themes emerge. You can now begin to break your audience down into sub-groups or segments. There's no 'correct' number here, but we recommend creating three to five personas to represent your audience; this number is big enough to cover the majority of your customers yet small enough to still be specific.
    - Click on the **Templates **button in the toolbar, and search for the "persona"** **template.
    - Drag the **Template **out on to the canvas.
    - Open the **Template **and click on "Clear example content" in the top right-hand corner.
    - Give the **Board** a representative name and repeat this step for each **Persona** that you require.

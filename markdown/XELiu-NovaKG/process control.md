- An [[industrial process control]] in [continuous production processes]([[continuous production]]) is a [[discipline]] that uses [[industrial control system (ICS)]]s to [achieve a production level of] consistency, economy and safety which [could not be achieved purely by] [human manual control](((3KVbVs8Tq))). It is [implemented widely in] industries such as automotive, mining, dredging, oil refining, pulp and paper manufacturing, [[chemical processing]] and [[power generating plant]]s.[1]

    - 过程控制是在工业系统中，为了控制过程的输出，利用统计或[工程上的方法][处理过程的结构]、运作方式或其[演算方式]。处理过程控制的系统可称为过程控制系统。
    - There is a wide range of size, type and complexity, but it enables [a small number of operators] to [manage complex processes] [to a high degree of consistency]([[consistency]]). The development of [large industrial process control systems] was instrumental in enabling the design of large high volume and complex processes, which [could not be otherwise] [economically or safely operated].[2]
    - [The applications can range from] [controlling the temperature and level of] 液位 a single [[process vessel]], 工艺容器 to a complete [chemical processing plant] [with several thousand] [[control loop]]s.

- Theory
    - All normal matter ([[baryonic matter]]) emits [[electromagnetic radiation]] when it has a temperature above [[absolute zero]]. The radiation represents [a conversion of]([[energy conversion]]) a body's [[internal energy]] into [[electromagnetic energy]], and is therefore called thermal radiation. It is a [[spontaneous process]] of [[radiative distribution of entropy]]. 熵辐射分布的自发过程
    - Conversely, all [[normal matter]] absorbs electromagnetic radiation to some degree. An object that [absorbs all radiation falling on it], at all wavelengths, is called a black body. When a black body is at a [[uniform temperature]], its emission has a [[characteristic frequency]] distribution that [depends on the temperature]. Its emission is called black-body radiation.
    - Color of a black body from 800 K to 12200 K. [This range of colors]([[color range]]) approximates the range of colors of [stars of different temperatures]([[star temperature]]), [as seen or photographed in] the [[night sky]].

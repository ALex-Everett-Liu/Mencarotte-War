    - Cable glands are commonly defined as mechanical cable entry devices.[4] They are used throughout a number of industries in conjunction with cable and wiring used in electrical instrumentation and automation systems. Cable glands may be used on all types of electrical power, control, instrumentation, data and telecommunications cables. They are used as a sealing and termination device to ensure that the characteristics of the enclosure which the cable enters can be maintained adequately. Cable glands are made of various plastics, and steel, brass or aluminum for industrial usage. Glands intended to resist dripping water or water pressure will include synthetic rubber or other types of elastomer seals. Certain types of cable glands may also serve to prevent entry of flammable gas into equipment enclosures, for electrical equipment in hazardous areas.
- 主要作用是电缆的紧固与密封。
    - 紧固是指通过格兰[锁紧电缆]，使电缆不产生[轴向位移]与[径向的旋转]，这样保证[电缆的连接正常]。
    - 密封是指常说的[IP防护]，即防尘防水，至于格兰的[防护等级]要看[各厂家]格兰的结构。最高可达 IP68。
        - 还有一些[特殊场所]使用的格兰，如[屏蔽的电缆]防水接头，适用带有[屏蔽层]的电缆；适用于[铠装电缆]的铠装电缆[防水接头]；适用于[矿井]等[危险区域]的[防爆电缆]防水接头等。

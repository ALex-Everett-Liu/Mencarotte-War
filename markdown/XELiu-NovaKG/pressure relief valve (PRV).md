- A [[relief valve]] or pressure relief valve (PRV) is a type of [[safety valve]] used to [control or limit the pressure in a system]; pressure might otherwise [build up and create a process upset], 过程混乱 instrument or equipment failure, or fire. The pressure is relieved by allowing the [pressurized fluid](((UFdxj2PZe))) to flow from an [auxiliary passage] [out of the system]. 辅助通道 The relief valve is designed or set to open [at a predetermined set pressure] to protect [[pressure vessel]]s and other equipment from [being subjected to pressures that] [exceed their design limits]. When the [[set pressure]] is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the "[[path of least resistance]]" as the valve is [forced open] and [a portion of the fluid] is [diverted through the auxiliary route]. 
    - In systems containing [flammable fluids], the [diverted fluid] (liquid, gas or [liquid-gas mixture]) is usually [routed through] a [[piping system]] known as a [[flare header]] or [[relief header]] to a central, [elevated gas flare] [where it is usually burned] and the resulting [[combustion gas]]es are [released to the atmosphere].[1](((JUMqQKLM4)))
    - In [non-hazardous systems], the fluid is often [discharged to the atmosphere] by a suitable [[discharge pipework]] 合适的排放管道 designed to [prevent rainwater ingress](((ZdYGdCLms))) which can [affect the set lift pressure], 提升压力 and positioned not to [cause a hazard to personnel]. 对人员造成危害 
    - As the fluid is diverted, [the pressure inside the vessel] will [stop rising]. Once it reaches the valve's [[reseating pressure]], 回弹/回座压力 the valve will close. The [[blowdown]] 排污; 放空 is usually stated as [a percentage of set pressure] and refers to [how much the pressure needs to drop] [before the valve reseats]. The blowdown can vary roughly 2–20%, and some valves have [adjustable blowdowns].

    - Notational hierarchy is [expressed by length of notation]. [Numbers at any given level] are usually [subordinate to a class] [whose notation is one digit shorter]; [coordinate with a class] whose notation [has the same number of] [[significant digit]]s; 有效位数 and [superordinate to a class] [with numbers one or more digits longer]. The [underlined digits] [in the following example] demonstrate this [[notational hierarchy]]:
        - ```css
600 Technology
630 Agriculture and related technologies 
636 Animal husbandry
636.7 Dogs 
636.8 Cats
```
        - “Dogs” and “Cats” are [more specific than] (i.e., are [[subordinate]] to) “Animal husbandry”; ^^they are [equally specific as each other]([[equally specific]]) (i.e., are coordinate with);^^ 相配合 and “Animal husbandry” is less specific than (i.e., is [[superordinate]] to) “Dogs” and “Cats.”

        - Sometimes, [other devices must be used to] [express the hierarchy] when [it is not possible or desirable to do so] [through the notation]. Special headings, notes, and entries [indicate relationships among topics] that [violate notational hierarchy].

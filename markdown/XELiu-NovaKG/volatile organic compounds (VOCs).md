- Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are [[organic chemical]]s that have a high [[vapour pressure]] at [[room temperature]]. High [[vapor pressure]] correlates with a low [[boiling point]], which relates to [the number of the sample's molecules] [in the surrounding air], a trait known as [[volatility]].[1]
(室温下蒸气压较高的有机化合物-沸点低-挥发性)
    - VOC's are responsible for the [[odor]] of [[scent]]s and [[perfume]]s as well as [[pollutant]]s. VOCs [play an important role in] [communication between animals and plants], e.g. attractants for pollinators,[2] protection from predation,[3] and even [[inter-plant interaction]]s.[4] 
    - Some VOCs are dangerous to [[human health]] or [cause harm to the environment]. [[anthropogenic VOCs]] are [regulated by law], especially indoors, where [[concentration]]s are the highest. Most VOCs are not [acutely toxic]([[toxic]]), but may have [long-term chronic health effects](((DBQDRfnJQ))).
    - 按照[世界卫生组织]的定义，如果在气压 101.32 kPa 下，该化合物的沸点在 50℃-250℃，就是挥发性有机物。它们会[在常温下][以气体形式存在]。
按其[化学结构]的不同，可以[进一步分为]八类：烷类、芳烃类、烯类、卤代烃类、酯类、醛类、酮类和其他。
VOC的主要成分有：烃类、卤代烃、氧烃和氮烃，它包括：苯系物、有机氯化物、氟里昂系列、有机酮、胺、醇、醚、酯、酸和石油烃化合物等。
例如，甲醛，它由[油漆]及[家俱]中[挥发出来]，其沸点只有 -19°C。
- Analytical methods 
    - Sampling
        - Obtaining samples for analysis is challenging. VOCs, even when at dangerous levels, are dilute, so preconcentration is typically required. Many components of the atmosphere are mutually incompatible, e.g. ozone and organic compounds, peroxyacyl nitrates and many organic compounds. Furthermore, collection of VOCs by condensation in cold traps also accummulates a large amount of water, which generally must be removed selectively, depending on the analytical techniques to be employed.[28] Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) techniques are used to collect VOCs at low concentrations for analysis.[53] As applied to breath analysis, the following modalities are employed for sampling: gas sampling bags, syringes, evacuated steel and glass containers.[54]

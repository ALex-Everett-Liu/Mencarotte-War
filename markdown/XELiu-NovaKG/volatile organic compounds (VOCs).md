- Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are [[organic chemical]]s that have a high [[vapour pressure]] at [[room temperature]]. High [[vapor pressure]] correlates with a low [[boiling point]], which relates to [the number of the sample's molecules] [in the surrounding air], a trait known as [[volatility]].[1]
(室温下蒸气压较高的有机化合物-沸点低-挥发性)
    - VOC's are responsible for the [[odor]] of [[scent]]s and [[perfume]]s as well as [[pollutant]]s. VOCs [play an important role in] [communication between animals and plants], e.g. attractants for pollinators,[2] protection from predation,[3] and even [[inter-plant interaction]]s.[4] 
    - Some VOCs are dangerous to [[human health]] or [cause harm to the environment]. [[anthropogenic VOCs]] are [regulated by law], especially indoors, where [[concentration]]s are the highest. Most VOCs are not [acutely toxic]([[toxic]]), but may have [long-term chronic health effects](((DBQDRfnJQ))).
    - 按照[世界卫生组织]的定义，如果在气压 101.32 kPa 下，该化合物的沸点在 50℃-250℃，就是挥发性有机物。它们会[在常温下][以气体形式存在]。

        - 按其[化学结构]的不同，可以[进一步分为]八类：烷类、芳烃类、烯类、卤代烃类、酯类、醛类、酮类和其他。
烃类主要成分有：烃类、卤代烃、氧烃和氮烃，包括：苯系物、有机氯化物、氟里昂系列、有机酮、胺、醇、醚、酯、酸和石油烃化合物等。
例如，甲醛，它由[油漆]及[家俱]中[挥发出来]，其沸点只有 -19°C。
- Definitions
    - [Diverse definitions] of the term VOC are in use.
    - China
        - The People's Republic of China defines a VOC [as those compounds that] have "originated from automobiles, [industrial production] and [civilian use], burning of all types of fuels, storage and transportation of oils, fitment finish, 装修饰面 coating for furniture and machines, [cooking oil fume] 烹调油烟 and [fine particles (PM 2.5)]", and [similar sources].[8] The [Three-Year Action Plan] for [Winning the Blue Sky Defence War] released by the [State Council] in July 2018 [creates an action plan to] reduce 2015 [VOC emissions] 10% by 2020.[9]

    - United States
        - The definitions of VOCs used for control of [[precursor]]s of [[photochemical smog]] used by the U.S. [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)] and [state agencies] in the US with independent [[outdoor air pollution]] regulations include [[exemption]]s for VOCs that are determined to be non-reactive, or [of low-reactivity](((f0u_bgNxZ))) in the [smog formation process]. Prominent is 突出的是 the VOC [regulation issued by] the [South Coast] [Air Quality Management District] 空气质量管理区 in California and by the [California Air Resources Board (CARB)].[13] 委员会 However, this [specific use] of the term VOCs [can be misleading], [especially when applied to] [[indoor air quality]] because many [[chemical]]s that are [not regulated as] outdoor air pollution [can still be important for] indoor air pollution.

    - European Union
        - The European Union defines a VOC as "any [[organic compound]] having an initial [[boiling point]] less than or equal to 250 °C (482 °F) measured at a [[standard atmospheric pressure]] of 101.3 kPa". The [VOC Solvents Emissions Directive] 排放指令 is the [main policy instrument] for the reduction of [[industrial emission]]s of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the European Union. [It covers a wide range of] [solvent using activities]([[solvent]]), e.g. printing, surface cleaning, vehicle coating, [dry cleaning] and manufacture of footwear and [pharmaceutical products]. 鞋类和医药产品 The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive [requires installations] [in which such activities are applied] to comply either with the [emission limit values](((29npoi7E2))) [set out in the Directive] or with the requirements of the so-called [reduction scheme]. Article 13 of The Paints Directive, approved in 2004, amended the original VOC Solvents Emissions Directive and limits the use of organic solvents in decorative paints and varnishes and in vehicle finishing products. The Paints Directive sets out maximum VOC content limit values for paints and varnishes in certain applications.[6][7]
        - [The singular focus on] the [[exchange rate]] appears [based on the assumption that] [it is the key cause of] the [[surplus]] and the [main policy instrument] for removing it. 主要政策工具 www.[[ftchinese]].com
- Analytical methods 
    - Sampling
        - Obtaining samples for analysis is challenging. VOCs, even when at dangerous levels, are dilute, so preconcentration is typically required. Many components of the atmosphere are mutually incompatible, e.g. ozone and organic compounds, peroxyacyl nitrates and many organic compounds. Furthermore, collection of VOCs by condensation in cold traps also accummulates a large amount of water, which generally must be removed selectively, depending on the analytical techniques to be employed.[28] Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) techniques are used to collect VOCs at low concentrations for analysis.[53] As applied to breath analysis, the following modalities are employed for sampling: gas sampling bags, syringes, evacuated steel and glass containers.[54]

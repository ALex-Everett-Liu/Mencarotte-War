- Everything from [[peer-reviewed]] [[research paper]]s to the [[opinion page]]s of a [[newspaper]] are [based on](((XSmlfO4Cr))) [formulating arguments]([[argument]]) that [support a certain premise]([[premise]]), along the lines of the following: #[[logical reasoning]]
201123-22:08
    - If A is true, then B is true.
If C and D are [[both true]], then A is true.
Therefore, B is true.
        - [Example]: say I have [a collection of statements]([[statement]]) like these     #[[precise link]]
            - [[Socrates]] is a Man
Socrates is [Mortal]
All Men are Mortal
            - [[certainty]] : : { { [[slider]] } } | [url here](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/bDlZbAB-p).
            - Then I can [reference those statements]([[reference]]) into a [[compound statement]] like this
If ( (73qfpWUie) ) and (Abv0yk7zT) then (eyR_sF2Hr)
                - I will then [see that statement] whenever I visit one of the [[block]]s that is [referenced within it]

                    - like this: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2FbGuVgwv7eo?alt=media&token=5cc08cb5-9668-4812-9084-38cd9cd816cf)
        - Often, C and D [will be supported by] [links to]([[external link]]) [external articles](((1j6jxQrx_))), ^^where they are [conclusions reached by]([[reach the conclusion]]) [larger arguments] based on [combining other premises](((MJR_1OkWl))).^^ 
    - Unfortunately, [the structure of the argument]([[argument structure]]) is [only implied by] the [[prose]]. ^^Rarely are [the relationships between arguments] and [pieces of evidence]([[evidence]]) [explicitly laid out],^^ 论据以及证据片段之间的关联很少得到显式的排布与展示 [except perhaps in] the notes of the author [investigating the claims]. 在提交人调查申诉/索赔的说明中 #pt8-100

(自然语言的论证过程中通常缺乏内在与显式的关联，而表现为一种零散的潜藏的结构)
(wow, 正好在半年后重新回顾这一小节)
        - Roam allows [individual researchers] or [[writer]]s to [organize all the claims] they [wish to make]([[make the claim]]) [across a number of different projects]. It also [creates opportunities for]([[opportunity]]) large-scale [[interdisciplinary]] [[research project]]s. When [teams of interested collaborators]([[collaborator]]) have an [[agreed-upon structure]] for [[formatting arguments]] and [counterarguments], 当感兴趣的合作者的团队达成商定一致的结构时 [it is possible to] create [[expandable]] [[user interface (UI)]]s which “bubble up” [[insight]] from claims which [require expertise]([[expertise]]), to ones that are [more easily understood by] [laypersons]. 外行

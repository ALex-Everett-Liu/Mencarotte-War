- A quantum dot display is a [[display device]] that uses [quantum dots (QD)], [[semiconductor nanocrystal]]s which can produce pure monochromatic[a] [red, green, and blue light].
    - [Photo-emissive quantum dot particles] are used in [[LCD backlight]]s and/or [display color filters](((-R8XuSNhL))). Quantum dots are [excited by the blue light] from the [[display panel]] to [emit pure basic colors], which [reduces light losses] and [[color crosstalk]] in [[color filter]]s, improving [[display brightness]] and [[color gamut]]. Light travels through QD layer film and traditional RGB filters made from color pigments, or through QD filters with red/green QD color converters and blue passthrough. Although the QD color filter technology is primarily used in LED-backlit LCDs, it is applicable to other display technologies which use color filters, such as blue/UV AMOLED/QNED/MicroLED display panels.[1][2][3] LED-backlit LCDs are the main application of photo-emissive quantum dots, though blue OLED panels with QD color filters are being researched.

    - Electro-emissive or electroluminiscent quantum dot displays are an experimental type of display based on quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LED; also EL-QLED, ELQD, QDEL). These displays are similar to active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) and MicroLED displays, in that light would be produced directly in each pixel by applying electric current to inorganic nano-particles. QD-LED displays could support large, flexible displays and would not degrade as readily as OLEDs, making them good candidates for flat-panel TV screens, digital cameras, mobile phones and handheld game consoles.[4][5][6]
    - As of 2022, all commercial products, such as LCD TVs branded as QLED, employ quantum dots as photo-emissive particles; electro-emissive QD-LED TVs exist in laboratories only.[7][8]
    - Quantum dot displays are capable of displaying wider color gamuts with some devices approaching full coverage of the BT.2020 color gamut.[9][10][11] QD-OLED and QD-LED displays can achieve the same contrast as OLED/MicroLED displays with "perfect" black levels in the off state, unlike LED-backlit LCDs.

- A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is [a unique sequence of characters] that [identifies a logical or physical resource] [used by web technologies]. URIs may be used to identify anything, including [[real-world object]]s, such as people and places, concepts, or [[information resource]]s such as [[web page]]s and books. Some URIs [provide a means of] locating and [retrieving]([[Information Retrieval (IR)]]) information resources on a network (either on the Internet or on another [[private network]], such as a computer [[filesystem]] or an [[Intranet]]), these are [[Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)]]. A URL provides [the location of the resource]([[resource location]]). A URI identifies the resource by name [at the specified location] or URL. 
    - Other URIs [provide only a unique name], [without a means of locating] or retrieving the resource or information about it, these are [[Uniform Resource Names (URNs)]]. The web technologies that use URIs are not limited to web browsers. URIs are used to identify anything described using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), for example, concepts that are part of an ontology defined using the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and people who are described using the Friend of a Friend vocabulary would each have an individual URI.

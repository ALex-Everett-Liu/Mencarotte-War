- Hot carrier injection (HCI) is a phenomenon in [[solid-state electronic device]]s where an electron or a “hole” gains sufficient [[kinetic energy]] to overcome a [[potential barrier]] necessary to [break an interface state]. The term "hot" refers to the [[effective temperature]] used to model [[carrier density]], not to the [overall temperature] of the device. Since the charge carriers can become trapped in the [[gate dielectric]] of a [[MOS transistor]], the [[switching characteristics]] of the transistor [can be permanently changed]. Hot-carrier injection is [one of the mechanisms that] [adversely affects] the [[reliability]] of semiconductors of solid-state devices.[1](((RgyDvTwJ5)))

    - The term “hot carrier injection” [usually refers to] the effect in [[metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)]]s, where [a carrier is injected from] the [[conducting channel]] in the [[silicon substrate]] to the gate dielectric, which usually is made of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO2).
    - To become “hot” and enter the [[conduction band]] of SiO2, an electron must [gain a kinetic energy of] ~3.2 eV. For holes, the [[valence band offset]] in this case dictates they must [have a kinetic energy of] 4.6 eV. The term "hot electron" comes from the effective temperature [term used when] [modelling carrier density] (i.e., with a [[Fermi-Dirac function]]) and [does not refer to] the [[bulk temperature]] of the semiconductor (which can be [physically cold], although the warmer it is, the higher [the population of hot electrons](((6bPCK-kx2))) it will contain all else being equal).

        - [The distribution of valence band offset] [could be altered by] adjusting the [buffer band gap], 缓冲层的带隙 which [leads to a change for the distribution of] [recombination rate]. 载流子复合率 www.[fabiao].net
        - The band offset between strained Ge_xSi (1-x) 应变的 and un strained Si is mainly due to the valence band offset Δ E_v. dict.cnki.net
    - The term “[[hot electron]]” was [originally introduced to describe] [[non-equilibrium electrons]] (or holes) in semiconductors.[2] More broadly, the term describes [[electron distribution]]s describable by the [[Fermi function]], but [with an elevated effective temperature]. [This greater energy affects] the [[mobility]] of [[charge carrier]]s and [as a consequence affects] [how they travel through] a [[semiconductor device]].[3]

    - Hot electrons can tunnel out of the [semiconductor material], instead of [recombining with a hole](((46XyMZrLY))) or [being conducted through the material to](((RP9d8dDLq))) a [[collector]]. 通过材料传导到收集器 [Consequent effects] include increased [[leakage current]] and [possible damage to] the encasing [[dielectric material]] if the [[hot carrier]] disrupts the [[atomic structure]] of the dielectric.

    - Hot electrons can be created when a [[high-energy photon]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (such as light) strikes a semiconductor. [The energy from the photon] can be transferred to an electron, [exciting the electron out of] the [[valence band]], and forming an [[electron-hole pair]]. If the electron [receives enough energy to] [leave the valence band], and to [surpass the conduction band], it becomes a hot electron. Such electrons are characterized by high effective temperatures. Because of the [high effective temperatures], hot electrons are very mobile, and [likely to leave the semiconductor] and [travel into other surrounding materials](((RP9d8dDLq))).

        - In some semiconductor devices, [the energy dissipated by hot electron phonons](((HLMMXSXI7))) represents an [[inefficiency]] as [energy is lost as heat](((rOJxEtGG2))). For instance, some [[solar cell]]s rely on the [photovoltaic properties](((YsA66noLY))) of semiconductors to [convert light to electricity](((QRAEJRgn0))). In such cells, the [hot electron effect] is the reason that [a portion of the light energy] is [lost to heat rather than] [converted to electricity].[4]

    - Hot electrons arise generically at [[low temperature]]s even in [[degenerate semiconductor]]s or metals.[5] [There are a number of models to describe] the [hot-electron effect](((aD7pOwYx1))).[6] The simplest predicts an [electron-phonon (e-p) interaction](((jHdcxKOGE))) based on a clean three-dimensional [free-electron model](((uona1w3tB))).[7][8](((0gXh_wm_W))) Hot electron effect models [illustrate a correlation between] [power dissipated](((rOJxEtGG2))), the [[electron gas temperature]] and overheating.

- Hot carrier injection (HCI) is a phenomenon in [[solid-state electronic device]]s where an electron or a “hole” gains sufficient [[kinetic energy]] to overcome a [[potential barrier]] necessary to [break an interface state]. The term "hot" refers to the [[effective temperature]] used to model [[carrier density]], not to the [overall temperature] of the device. Since the charge carriers can become trapped in the [[gate dielectric]] 栅介质 of a [[MOS transistor]], the [[switching characteristics]] 开关特性 of the transistor [can be permanently changed]. Hot-carrier injection is [one of the mechanisms that] [adversely affects] 产生不利影响 the [[reliability]] of semiconductors of solid-state devices.[1]

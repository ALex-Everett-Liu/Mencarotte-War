- The issue of [the actual nature of light] is central to [a complete treatment of] Optics, 完整处理 and we will [struggle with it] [throughout this work]. The [straightforward question] “Is light a [wave phenomenon] or a [particle phenomenon]?” is [far more complicated than] it might [at first seem]. For example, the [essential feature] of a particle is its [[localization]]; it exists in a [well-defined](((_ypOsExd2))), “small” region of space. Practically, we tend to [take something familiar like] a ball or a pebble and [shrink it down in imagination] until it [becomes vanishingly small], and that’s a “particle,” or at least [the basis for the concept] of “particle.” 
    - But a ball [interacts with its environment]; it has a [[gravitational field]] that [interacts with the Earth] (and the Moon, and Sun, etc.). This field, which [spreads out into space](((aBIZxAxoS)))—whatever it is—cannot be [separated from the ball]; it is [an inextricable part] of the ball 不可分, 解不开, 无法解救, 无法逃脱 just as it is an inextricable part of the definition of “particle.” Real particles interact via fields, and, in a sense, [the field is the particle] and [the particle is the field]. That little conundrum is the domain of [[quantum field theory]], a discipline we’ll talk more about later (p. 148). [Suffice it to say](((9ZM8jcLez))) now that if light is a stream of [[submicroscopic particle]]s (photons), they are by no means “ordinary” miniball [[classical particle]]s.
(粒子的基本特征-局域化-存在于一个定义良好的小空间范围内--与周围环境相互作用的引力场-同样是粒子不可分割的基本属性-即粒子与场无法区分)

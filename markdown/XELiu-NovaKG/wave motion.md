- The issue of [the actual nature of light] is central to [a complete treatment of] Optics, 完整处理 and we will [struggle with it] [throughout this work]. The [straightforward question] “Is light a [wave phenomenon] or a [particle phenomenon]?” is [far more complicated than] it might [at first seem]. For example, the [essential feature] of a particle is its [[phys/localization]]; it exists in a [well-defined](((b0Gl7Hyax))), “small” region of space. Practically, we tend to [take something familiar like] a ball or a pebble and [shrink it down in imagination] until it [becomes vanishingly small], and that’s a “particle,” or at least [the basis for the concept] of “particle.” 
    - But a ball [interacts with its environment]; it has a [[gravitational field]] that [interacts with the Earth] (and the Moon, and Sun, etc.). This field, which [spreads out into space](((U24HzqPt5)))—whatever it is—cannot be [separated from the ball]; it is [an inextricable part] of the ball 不可分, 解不开, 无法解救, 无法逃脱 just as it is an inextricable part of the definition of “particle.” Real particles interact via fields, and, in a sense, [the field is the particle] and [the particle is the field]. That little conundrum is the domain of [[quantum field theory]], a discipline we’ll talk more about later (p. 148). [Suffice it to say](((I7EgTBZcL))) now that if light is a stream of [[submicroscopic particle]]s (photons), they are by no means “ordinary” miniball [[classical particle]]s.

- On the other hand, the essential feature of a wave is its [[non-localization]]. A classical [[traveling wave]] is a [[self-sustaining disturbance]] of a medium, which [moves through space] [transporting energy and momentum]. We tend to think of the [[ideal wave]] as a [[continuous entity]] that [exists over an extended region](((nH20PK-pw))). But when we [look closely at real waves] (such as [waves on strings](((ZY6g2j-39))), we see [[composite phenomena]] comprising [vast numbers of particles] [moving in concert]. 协同运动 The media supporting these waves are atomic (i.e., particulate), 微粒 and so the waves are not continuous entities in and of themselves. 
    - [The only possible exception] might be the [[electromagnetic wave]]. Conceptually, the classical electromagnetic wave (p. 54) is [supposed to be a continuous entity], and [it serves as the model for] [the very notion of wave] as [distinct from particle]. But [in the past century] we found that [the energy of an electromagnetic wave]([[energy distribution]]) is not [distributed continuously]. The [classical formulation] of the [electromagnetic theory of light](((UlPALKSFZ))), however wonderful it is on a [[macroscopic level]], is profoundly wanting on a [[microscopic level]]. 在微观层面上极度匮乏

    - Einstein [was the first to suggest that] the electromagnetic wave, which we [perceive macroscopically], is the [[statistical manifestation]] of a [fundamentally granular underlying microscopic phenomenon] 颗粒状的 (p. 61). In the [subatomic domain](((ZYsxlpgsh))), the [classical concept] of a [[physical wave]] is an illusion. Still, in the [large-scale regime](((OePksWN-e))) [in which we ordinarily work], electromagnetic waves [seem real enough] and [classical theory] [applies superbly well].
(行波-媒介的自我维持的扰动--实际的波如弦波是大量粒子的协同运动组成的复合现象-以原子/微粒作为媒介的扰动-^^因而不是一个空间中的连续的实体^^-唯独电磁波被视为是连续的，从而与不连续的粒子彻底区分开来-但实际上电磁波的能量分配是不连续的-光的电磁理论在微观层面上极度匮乏，给不出合适的解释-宏观上看似连续的电磁波实际上是一种特殊微观粒子的统计表现)

- Because both the classical and [quantum-mechanical treatments of light] make use of [the mathematical description of waves], this chapter [lays out the basics] of what [both formalisms will need]. [The ideas we develop here] will [apply to all physical waves], from a [surface tension ripple](((mRdJOxNmw))) [in a cup of tea] to [a pulse of light](((kwLfmu4hB))) [reaching us from some distant galaxy].

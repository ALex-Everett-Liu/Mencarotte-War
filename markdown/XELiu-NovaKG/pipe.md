- Pipe ([[fluid conveyance]]), a [hollow cylinder] [following certain dimension rules]([[dimension rule]]) 遵循一定尺寸规则
- A pipe is a [tubular section] or hollow cylinder, [usually but not necessarily] of [[circular cross-section]], [used mainly to] [convey substances which can flow]([[flow]]) — liquids and gases ([[fluid]]s), slurries, [[powder]]s and [masses of small solids]. 泥浆、粉末和小固体块 [It can also be used for] [[structural application]]s; [[hollow pipe]] is far stiffer [per unit weight] than [solid members].

    - [In common usage] the words pipe and tube are [usually interchangeable], but [in industry and engineering], the terms are [uniquely defined]. Depending on the [applicable standard] to which it is manufactured, pipe is [generally specified by] a [[nominal diameter (DN)]] with a constant [[outside diameter (OD)]] and a [[schedule]] 明细表 that [defines the thickness]([[thickness]]). Tube is most often specified by the OD and [[wall thickness]], but may be specified by any two of OD, [[inside diameter (ID)]], and wall thickness.

        - Pipe is generally manufactured to one of several [international and national industrial standards].[1] While [similar standards] exist for [specific industry application tubing], tube is often made to [[custom size]]s and [a broader range of diameters] and [[tolerance]]s. Many [industrial and government standards] exist for the production of pipe and [[tubing]]. The term "tube" is also [commonly applied to] [non-cylindrical sections], i.e., square or rectangular tubing. In general, "pipe" is [the more common term] [in most of the world], whereas "tube" is [more widely used in] [the United States].
        - Both "pipe" and "tube" imply a level of rigidity and permanence, whereas a hose (or hosepipe) is usually portable and flexible. Pipe assemblies are almost always constructed with the use of fittings such as elbows, tees, and so on, while tube may be formed or bent into custom configurations. For materials that are inflexible, cannot be formed, or where construction is governed by codes or standards, tube assemblies are also constructed with the use of tube fittings.

- # DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TUBE AND PIPE
    - ## Is It a Pipe or a Tube?
        - [In some instances] [the terms may be used interchangeably], however [there is one key difference between] [[tube]] and [[pipe]], particularly in [how the material is ordered and toleranced]. Tubing is used in [[structural application]]s so the [[outside diameter (OD)]] [becomes the important dimension]. Tubes are often [put into applications such as] [[medical device]]s that [require precise outside diameters]. The outside diameter is important since it will indicate how much it can hold as a stability factor. Whereas pipes are normally used to transport gasses or liquids making it important to know the capacity. Knowing how much can flow through the pipe is key. The circular shape of the pipe make it efficient when handling pressure from the liquid flowing through.

- Pipe ([[fluid conveyance]]), a [hollow cylinder] [following certain dimension rules]([[dimension rule]]) 遵循一定尺寸规则
- A pipe is a [tubular section] or hollow cylinder, [usually but not necessarily] of [[circular cross-section]], [used mainly to] [convey substances which can flow]([[flow]]) — liquids and gases ([[fluid]]s), slurries, [[powder]]s and [masses of small solids]. 泥浆、粉末和小固体块 [It can also be used for] [[structural application]]s; [[hollow pipe]] is far stiffer [per unit weight] than [solid members].

    - [In common usage] the words pipe and tube are [usually interchangeable], but [in industry and engineering], the terms are [uniquely defined]. Depending on the [applicable standard] to which it is manufactured, pipe is [generally specified by] a [[nominal diameter (DN)]] with a constant [[outside diameter (OD)]] and a [[schedule]] 明细表 that [defines the thickness]([[thickness]]). Tube is most often specified by the OD and [[wall thickness]], but may be specified by any two of OD, [[inside diameter (ID)]], and wall thickness.

        - Pipe is generally manufactured to one of several [international and national industrial standards].[1] While [similar standards] exist for [specific industry application tubing], tube is often made to [[custom size]]s and [a broader range of diameters] and [[tolerance]]s. Many [industrial and government standards] exist for the production of pipe and [[tubing]]. The term "tube" is also [commonly applied to] [non-cylindrical sections], i.e., square or rectangular tubing. In general, "pipe" is [the more common term] [in most of the world], whereas "tube" is [more widely used in] [the United States].
        - Both "pipe" and "tube" [imply a level of] [[rigidity]] and [[permanence]], 意味着一定程度的刚性和持久性 whereas a [[hose]] (or [[hosepipe]]) 橡皮软管, 水龙软管; 长筒袜 is usually [[portable]] and [[flexible]]. [Pipe assemblies]([[assembly]]) are almost always [constructed with the use of] [[fittings]] such as [[elbow]]s, 弯头 [[tee]]s, 三通 and so on, while tube may be [formed or bent into] [[custom configuration]]s. 弯曲成 For [materials that are inflexible](((6no64KUA8))), cannot be formed, or where construction is [governed by codes or standards], 受规范或标准管制 [tube assemblies] are also [constructed with the use of tube fittings].

- # [DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TUBE AND PIPE](https://eagletube.com/about-us/news/difference-tube-pipe/)
    - ## Is It a Pipe or a Tube?
        - [In some instances] [the terms may be used interchangeably], however [there is one key difference between] [[tube]] and [[pipe]], particularly in [how the material is ordered and toleranced]. Tubing is used in [[structural application]]s so the [[outside diameter (OD)]] [becomes the important dimension]. Tubes are often [put into applications such as] [[medical device]]s that [require precise outside diameters]. The outside diameter is important since [it will indicate] [how much it can hold] as a [stability factor]. Whereas pipes are [normally used to] [transport gasses or liquids](((VG5w3zSU6))) [making it important to know] the [[capacity]]. Knowing how much can [flow through the pipe] is key. The [circular shape] of the pipe [make it efficient] when [handling pressure from] [the liquid flowing through].

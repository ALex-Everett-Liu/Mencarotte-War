- It opens
to this gentle breeze
of Spring
the sealed-in cold
of the still season,
and the boats [return to the sea] . . .
Now we must braid
crowns with which 
to [adorn our heads]. (I, 4) 编织花冠
- ### SPEED ALSO SLOWS DOWN TIME
    - [A moving object] therefore [experiences a shorter duration than] a stationary one: a watch [marks fewer seconds], a plant [grows more slowly], [a young man] [dreams less]. For a moving object, [time contracts](((weG9Xmga-))).* Not only is there no [single time] [for different places]— there is not even [a single time for any particular place]. A [[duration]] [can be associated only with] [the movement of something], with a given [[trajectory]].
(不仅不同位置不存在同一个统一的时间，实际上任何位置都不存在单独的时间-只有对于一个运动物体的轨迹才能够谈论时间)
211208-23:00
        - “[[proper time]]” [depends not only on] [where you are] and [your degree of proximity to masses]; [it depends also on] [the speed at which you move].
        - It’s a [strange enough] fact in itself, but its consequences are extraordinary. ^^Hold on tight, because we are [about to take off].^^ -- Cooooooooool
        - * “In motion” in relation to what? [How can we determine] [which of the two objects moves], if motion is only relative? [This is an issue that] [confuses many]. The [correct answer] (rarely given) is this: [in motion relative to]([[relative motion]]) the only [[reference]] in which [the point in space] [where the two clocks separate] is [the same point in space] where they [get back together]. There is only [a single straight line] [between two events in spacetime](((PyBKSCT4T))), from A to B: it’s the one along which time is maximum, and [the speed relative to this line] is the one that [slows time]. If [the clocks separate] and are not [brought together again], [there is no point asking] [which one is fast] and [which one is slow]. If they [come together], they [can be compared], and [the speed of each one] becomes a [[well-defined]] notion. #pt10-100

- ### “NOW” MEANS NOTHING
    - [What is happening “now”] [in a distant place]? Imagine, for example, that your sister has gone to [[Proxima b]], [the recently discovered planet] that [orbits a star] [at approximately four light-years’ distance from us]. What is your sister doing now on Proxima b?
211208-23:12
        - [The only correct answer is that] [the question makes no sense]. [It is like asking] “What is here, in Beijing?” when we are in Venice. [It makes no sense because] [if I use the word] “here” in Venice, I am [referring to a place in] Venice, not in Beijing.
        - [If you ask] what your sister, who is [in the room with you], is doing now, the answer is [usually an easy one]: [you look at her] [and you can tell]. If she’s far away, [you phone her] and [ask what she’s doing]. But take care: if you look at your sister, you are [receiving light] that [travels from her to your eyes]. The light [takes time to reach you], [let’s say] [a few nanoseconds]—[a tiny fraction of] a second—therefore, [you are not quite] seeing [what she is doing now] but [what she was doing] [a few nanoseconds ago]. If she is in New York and you phone her from Liverpool, her voice [takes a few milliseconds to] reach you, so [the most you can claim to know is] what your sister was up to a few milliseconds ago. Not a significant difference, perhaps.
211208-23:30
    - [The truth of the matter is that] [we need to give up] [asking the question]. 27
        - ^^[There is no special moment on] Proxima b that corresponds to [what constitutes the present here and now].^^
        - Dear reader, [pause for a moment to] [let this conclusion sink in]. In my opinion, [it is the most astounding conclusion] arrived at in the whole of [contemporary physics].
        - [27]: If I see my sister [through a telescope] [celebrating her twentieth birthday] and [send her a radio message] that will arrive on her twenty-eighth birthday, [I can say that] now is her twenty-fourth birthday: [halfway between] [when the light departed from] there (20) and when it returned (28). It’s a nice idea (not mine: it’s Einstein’s definition of “[[simultaneity]]”). But this does not [define a common time]. 
            - If Proxima b is [moving away], and my sister [uses the same logic to] [calculate the moment simultaneous to] her twenty-fourth birthday, she [does not obtain] the [present moment] here. In other words, [in this way of defining] simultaneity, if for me a moment A [in her life] is simultaneous with a moment B in mine, the contrary is not the case: for her, A and B are not simultaneous. Our [different speeds] [define different surfaces of simultaneity]. [Not even in this way do we obtain] a notion of [a common “present”].
211208-23:48
    - [It simply makes no sense to ask] [which moment in the life of] your sister on Proxima b [corresponds to now]. [It is like asking] which football team has won a basketball championship, how much money a swallow has earned, or how much a musical note weighs. They are nonsensical questions because football teams play football, not basketball; swallows do not busy themselves earning money; sounds cannot be weighed. “Basketball champions” refers to a team of basketball players, not to footballers. [Monetary profit] refers to [human society], not to swallows. The notion of “the present” [refers to things that] are [close to us], not to anything that is far away. 
        - Our “present” does not [extend throughout the universe]. It is like [a bubble around us]. #pt10-100
            - How far does this bubble extend? It depends on the [[precision]] with which we [determine time]. If by nanoseconds, the present is [defined only over a few meters]; if by milliseconds, it is [defined over thousands of kilometers]. As humans, we distinguish [tenths of a second] [only with great difficulty]; ^^[we can easily consider] [our entire planet] [to be like a single bubble] [where we can speak of the present] [as if it were an instant shared by us all].^^ This is [as far as we can go].
        - There is our past: [all the events that happened before] [what we can witness now]. There is our future: [the events that will happen] [after the moment from which] [we can see the here and now]. Between this past and this future [there is an interval that] is [neither past nor future] and [still has a duration]: fifteen minutes on Mars; eight years on Proxima b; [millions of years] in the [Andromeda galaxy]. It is the [expanded present](((H6sJvp4r1))). 28 It is perhaps the greatest and strangest of [Einstein’s discoveries].
            - The idea that [a well-defined now exists] [throughout the universe] is an illusion, [an illegitimate extrapolation] 不合理的推断 of [our own experience]. 29
                - It is like the point [where the rainbow touches the forest]. [We think that] [we can see it]—but if we [go to look for it], it isn’t there.
            - [28]: [The combination of events] that are [at spacelike distance from here].
            - [29]: [Among the first to realize this] was [[Kurt Gödel]]; see “[An Example of a New Type of] [Cosmological Solutions] of [Einstein’s Field Equations of Gravitation],” __Reviews of Modern Physics__ 21 (1949): 447–50. In his own words: “[The notion of ‘now’] is [nothing more than] [a certain relation between] [a certain observer]([[observer]]) and [the rest of the universe].”
        - If I were to ask, “Are these two stones [at the same height]?” in interplanetary space, the correct answer would be: “[It’s a question that] [doesn’t make sense], because there isn’t [a single notion of] ‘same height’ throughout the universe.” If I ask whether two events—one on Earth and the other on Proxima b—are happening “at the same moment,” the correct answer would be: “It’s a question that doesn’t make sense, because [there is no such thing as] ‘the same moment’ [definable in the universe].”

            - The “present of the universe” is meaningless.
- ### TEMPORAL STRUCTURE WITHOUT THE PRESENT
    - Mathematicians [have a term for] [the order established by filiation]: “partial order.” A [[partial order]] [establishes a relation of before and after] [between certain elements], but not between [any two of them]. [Human beings] form a “partially ordered” set (not a [“completely ordered” set](((1Snn-tJnf)))) through filiation. Filiation establishes an order (before the descendants, after the forebears), but not between everyone. To see how this order works, [we need only think of] a [[family tree]], like this one for Gorgo:
211209-22:30
        - There is a cone-shaped “past” made up of her forebears, and a [“future” cone] [comprising her descendants]. Those who are [neither ancestors nor descendants] [remain outside of the cones].
        - Every human being has their own [past cone] of ancestors and [future cone] of descendants. Those of Leonidas are [shown below], alongside Gorgo’s:
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FXELiu-NovaKG%2Fv7AT1IpTcx.jpg?alt=media&token=f316f7a2-8831-434d-a7fa-94a68635992a)
    - [The temporal structure of the universe] is [very similar to this one]. It is also made of cones. The relation of [“temporal precedence”](((TusF9aPca))) is [a partial order made of cones]. 31 Special relativity is the discovery that the temporal structure of the universe is like the one established by filiation: it [defines an order between] [the events of the universe] that is partial, not complete. The [expanded present](((H6sJvp4r1))) is [the set of events] that are neither past nor future: it exists, just as there are human beings who are neither our descendants nor our forebears.
211209-23:13
        - If we want to [represent all the events in the universe] and their [temporal relations](((Gg8x3LaXo))), [we can no longer do so with] [a single, universal distinction between] [past, present, and future], like this:
        - [We must do so instead by] [placing above and below every event] [the cones of its future and past events]:
    - Ten years later, he [comes to understand that] [the speed at which time flows] [changes from place to place]. It follows that [[spacetime]] [does not really have the order] [outlined above] but [can be distorted]. It now looks rather more like this:
211211-09:40
        - When a [[gravitational wave]] passes, for example, the small [[light cone]]s [oscillate together from right to left], like [ears of wheat] [blown by the wind].
        - [The structure of the cones] [can even be such that], advancing always [toward the future], one can [return to the same point] in spacetime, like this:
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FXELiu-NovaKG%2FOgja99tbbX.png?alt=media&token=a0e041d1-a296-49f2-83b0-11363b482445)
            - In this way, [a continuous trajectory toward the future] [returns to the originating event], to where it began.* 32 [The first to realize this was] [[Kurt Gödel]], the great twentieth-century logician who was Einstein’s last friend, [accompanying him on walks] [along the streets] of Princeton.
                - * The “closed temporal lines,” where [the future returns us to the past], are the ones that [frighten those who imagine that] a son [could go on to kill his mother] [before his own birth]. But there is no [logical contradiction] [entailed by the existence of] [[closed temporal line]]s or [journeys to the past]; [we are the ones who] [complicate things with] our [confused fantasies] about [the supposed freedom of the future].
211211-10:48
                - [32]: The fact that [there is nothing logically impossible about] [travels to the past] is [demonstrated clearly in] [an engaging article] by [one of the great philosophers] [of the last century]: David Lewis, “The Paradoxes of Time Travel,” __American Philosophical Quarterly__ 13 (1976): 145–52, reprinted in __The Philosophy of Time__, eds. R. Le Poidevin and M. MacBeath (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993). #[[time travel]]
    - If the present [has no meaning], then what “exists” in the universe? Is not what “exists” precisely [what is here] “in the present”? [The whole idea that] the universe exists now [in a certain configuration] and [changes together] [with the passage of time](((UQ4yO63do))) simply [doesn’t stack up anymore].

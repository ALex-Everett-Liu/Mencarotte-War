- The holographic principle is [a tenet of string theories]([[string theory]]) and [a supposed property of quantum gravity] that states that the description of [a volume of space] [can be thought of as] [encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region]—such as a [[light-like boundary]] like a [[gravitational horizon]]. First proposed by [[Gerard 't Hooft]], it was given [a precise string-theory interpretation] by [[Leonard Susskind]],[1] who [combined his ideas with] [previous ones] of 't Hooft and [[Charles Thorn]]. [1][2] 
    - Leonard Susskind said, “The [three-dimensional world] of [ordinary experience]––the universe [filled with galaxies], stars, planets, houses, boulders, and people––is a [[hologram]], [an image of reality] [cited on a distant two-dimensional (2D) surface]."[3] [As pointed out by] Raphael Bousso,[4] Thorn observed in 1978 that string theory admits [a lower-dimensional description] in which [gravity emerges from it] [in what would now be called] [a holographic way]. [The prime example of] holography is the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].

- The holographic principle was inspired by [[black hole thermodynamics]], which conjectures that the [[maximal entropy]] [in any region] [scales with the radius squared], and [not cubed] [as might be expected]. In the case of a black hole, [the insight was that] the [informational content] of [all the objects] that [have fallen into the hole] [might be entirely contained in] [[surface fluctuation]]s of the [[event horizon]]. The holographic principle resolves the [[black hole information paradox]] [within the framework of] string theory.[3] 
    - However, there exist [classical solutions] to the [[Einstein equations]] that allow [values of the entropy] [larger than those allowed by] an [[area law]], hence [in principle larger than those of] a black hole. These are the so-called "[[Wheeler's bags of gold]]". [The existence of such solutions] conflicts with the [holographic interpretation], and [their effects in] a [quantum theory of gravity] including the holographic principle are [not fully understood yet].[5]

    - Sabine Hossenfelder has demonstrated that the holographic principle is compatible with [Loop Quantum Gravity]([[loop quantum gravity]]) as well.[6]

    - [Hawking's calculation] suggested that [the radiation which black holes emit] is [not related in any way to] [the matter that they absorb]. [The outgoing light rays] [start exactly at the edge of the black hole] and [spend a long time near the horizon], while [the infalling matter] [only reaches the horizon much later]. [The infalling and outgoing mass/energy interact] [only when they cross]. [It is implausible that] the [outgoing state] [would be completely determined by] [some tiny residual scattering].[citation needed] 残余散射
(黑洞释放辐射量与其吸收辐射无关-射出的辐射和陷入黑洞的辐射尽在相交时才会有相互作用)

    - [Hawking interpreted this to mean that] when [[black hole]]s [absorb some photons] in a [[pure state]] described by a [[wave function]], they [re-emit new photons] in a [[thermal mixed state]] described by a [[density matrix]]. [This would mean that] quantum mechanics [would have to be modified] because, in quantum mechanics, [states which are superpositions with](((PV4WEEVrV))) [[probability amplitude]]s [never become] states which are [probabilistic mixtures of different possibilities].[note 1]

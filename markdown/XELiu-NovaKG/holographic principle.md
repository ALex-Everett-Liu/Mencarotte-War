- The holographic principle is [a tenet of string theories]([[string theory]]) and [a supposed property of quantum gravity] that states that the description of [a volume of space] [can be thought of as] [encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region]—such as a [[light-like boundary]] like a [[gravitational horizon]]. First proposed by [[Gerard 't Hooft]], it was given [a precise string-theory interpretation] by [[Leonard Susskind]],[1] who [combined his ideas with] [previous ones] of 't Hooft and [[Charles Thorn]]. [1][2]

    - Leonard Susskind said, “The [three-dimensional world] of [ordinary experience]––the universe [filled with galaxies], stars, planets, houses, boulders, and people––is a [[hologram]], [an image of reality] [cited on a distant two-dimensional (2D) surface]."[3] [As pointed out by] Raphael Bousso,[4] Thorn observed in 1978 that string theory admits [a lower-dimensional description] in which [gravity emerges from it] [in what would now be called] [a holographic way]. [The prime example of] holography is the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].

- The holographic principle was inspired by [[black hole thermodynamics]], [which conjectures that](((irHwhxIRq))) the [[maximal entropy]] [in any region] [scales with the radius squared], and [not cubed] [as might be expected]. In the case of a black hole, [the insight was that] the [informational content] of [all the objects] that [have fallen into the hole] [might be entirely contained in] [[surface fluctuation]]s of the [[event horizon]]. The holographic principle resolves the [[black hole information paradox]] [within the framework of] string theory.[3]

    - However, there exist [classical solutions] to the [[Einstein equations]] that allow [values of the entropy] [larger than those allowed by] an [[area law]], hence [in principle larger than those of] a black hole. These are the so-called "[[Wheeler's bags of gold]]". [The existence of such solutions] conflicts with the [holographic interpretation], and [their effects in] a [quantum theory of gravity] including the holographic principle are [not fully understood yet].[5]

    - Sabine Hossenfelder has demonstrated that the holographic principle is compatible with [Loop Quantum Gravity]([[loop quantum gravity]]) as well.[6]
- The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]
    - The [anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence], 共形场论 sometimes called [[Maldacena duality]] or [[gauge/gravity duality]], is [a conjectured relationship between] [two kinds of physical theories](((XgmY0O5Sj))). On one side are [[anti-de Sitter space (AdS)]]s which are used in theories of [[quantum gravity]], [formulated in terms of] [[string theory]] or [[M-theory]]. On the other side of the correspondence are [conformal field theories (CFT)]([[conformal field theory (CFT)]]) which are [quantum field theories]([[quantum field theory]]), [including theories similar to] the [Yang–Mills theories]([[Yang–Mills theory]]) that describe [[elementary particle]]s.

    - The duality represents a major advance in our understanding of string theory and quantum gravity.[7] This is because it provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions and because it is the most successful realization of the holographic principle.
    - It also provides a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories.[8] Much of the usefulness of the duality results from the fact that it is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.
    - The AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997. Important aspects of the correspondence were elaborated in articles by Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov, and Alexander Markovich Polyakov, and by Edward Witten. By 2015, Maldacena's article had over 10,000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article in the field of high energy physics.[9]

    - [Hawking's calculation] suggested that [the radiation which black holes emit] is [not related in any way to] [the matter that they absorb]. [The outgoing light rays] [start exactly at the edge of the black hole] and [spend a long time near the horizon], while [the infalling matter] [only reaches the horizon much later]. [The infalling and outgoing mass/energy interact] [only when they cross]. [It is implausible that] the [outgoing state] [would be completely determined by] [some tiny residual scattering].[citation needed] 残余散射

    - [Hawking interpreted this to mean that] when [[black hole]]s [absorb some photons] in a [[pure state]] described by a [[wave function]], they [re-emit new photons] in a [[thermal mixed state]] described by a [[density matrix]]. [This would mean that] quantum mechanics [would have to be modified] because, in quantum mechanics, [states which are superpositions with](((PV4WEEVrV))) [[probability amplitude]]s [never become] states which are [probabilistic mixtures of different possibilities].[note 1]

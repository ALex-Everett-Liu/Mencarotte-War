- The holographic principle is [a tenet of string theories]([[string theory]]) and [a supposed property of quantum gravity] that states that the description of [a volume of space] [can be thought of as] [encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region]—such as a [[light-like boundary]] like a [[gravitational horizon]]. First proposed by [[Gerard 't Hooft]], it was given [a precise string-theory interpretation] by [[Leonard Susskind]],[1] who [combined his ideas with] [previous ones] of 't Hooft and [[Charles Thorn]]. [1][2]

    - Leonard Susskind said, “The [three-dimensional world] of [ordinary experience]––the universe [filled with galaxies], stars, planets, houses, boulders, and people––is a [[hologram]], [an image of reality] [cited on a distant two-dimensional (2D) surface]."[3] [As pointed out by] Raphael Bousso,[4] Thorn observed in 1978 that string theory admits [a lower-dimensional description] in which [gravity emerges from it] [in what would now be called] [a holographic way]. [The prime example of] holography is the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].

- The holographic principle was inspired by [[black hole thermodynamics]], [which conjectures that](((irHwhxIRq))) the [[maximal entropy]] [in any region] [scales with the radius squared], and [not cubed] [as might be expected]. In the case of a black hole, [the insight was that] the [informational content] of [all the objects] that [have fallen into the hole] [might be entirely contained in] [[surface fluctuation]]s of the [[event horizon]]. The holographic principle resolves the [[black hole information paradox]] [within the framework of] string theory.[3]

    - However, there exist [classical solutions] to the [[Einstein equations]] that allow [values of the entropy] [larger than those allowed by] an [[area law]], hence [in principle larger than those of] a black hole. These are the so-called "[[Wheeler's bags of gold]]". [The existence of such solutions] conflicts with the [holographic interpretation], and [their effects in] a [quantum theory of gravity] including the holographic principle are [not fully understood yet].[5]

    - Sabine Hossenfelder has demonstrated that the holographic principle is compatible with [Loop Quantum Gravity]([[loop quantum gravity]]) as well.[6]
- The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]
    - The [anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence], 共形场论 sometimes called [[Maldacena duality]] or [[gauge/gravity duality]], is [a conjectured relationship between] [two kinds of physical theories](((XgmY0O5Sj))). On one side are [[anti-de Sitter space (AdS)]]s which are used in theories of [[quantum gravity]], [formulated in terms of] [[string theory]] or [[M-theory]]. On the other side of the correspondence are [conformal field theories (CFT)]([[conformal field theory (CFT)]]) which are [quantum field theories]([[quantum field theory]]), [including theories similar to] the [Yang–Mills theories]([[Yang–Mills theory]]) that describe [[elementary particle]]s.
220127-11:15
    - The duality represents [a major advance in our understanding of] string theory and quantum gravity.[7] This is because it provides a [non-perturbative formulation](((314Snblzm))) of string theory [with certain boundary conditions]([[boundary condition]]) and because it is [the most successful realization of] the holographic principle.
220127-23:43
    - It also [provides a powerful toolkit for] studying [strongly coupled](((SPZQAFDsa))) quantum field theories.[8] [Much of the usefulness of] the duality [results from the fact that] it is a [[strong-weak duality]]: when the fields of the quantum field theory are [strongly interacting](((SPZQAFDsa))), the ones in the [[gravitational theory]] are [weakly interacting] and thus [more mathematically tractable]. [This fact has been used to] [study many aspects of] [nuclear and condensed matter physics] by [translating problems in those subjects into] [more mathematically tractable problems] in string theory.

220128-00:40
    - The AdS/CFT correspondence was [first proposed by] [[Juan Maldacena]] in late 1997. [Important aspects of] the correspondence were [elaborated in articles by] Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov, and Alexander Markovich Polyakov, and by Edward Witten. By 2015, Maldacena's article [had over 10,000 citations], becoming [the most highly cited article](((uAP2WoJYY))) [in the field of] [[high energy physics]].[9]
- [Black hole entropy]([[black hole entropy]])
    - An object [with relatively high entropy](((gOE3b7p-n))) is [microscopically random](((Fiiu8kM5p))), like a [hot gas]. [A known configuration of] [[classical field]]s has [[zero entropy]]: [there is nothing random about] [electric and magnetic fields], or gravitational waves. Since black holes are [exact solutions] of [[Einstein's equation]]s, [they were thought not to have] any entropy either.

(高熵的物体在微观上随机性较强-经典场的零熵态)
        - But [[Jacob Bekenstein]] noted that this [leads to a violation of] [[the second law of thermodynamics]]. If one throws [a hot gas with entropy]([[hot gas]]) into a black hole, once it crosses the [[event horizon]], the entropy would disappear. The [random properties](((Fiiu8kM5p))) of the gas [would no longer be seen] [once the black hole had absorbed the gas] and settled down. One way of [salvaging the second law] is if black holes are in fact [random objects with an entropy] that [increases by an amount greater than] [the entropy of the consumed gas].
(假设黑洞有熵，是具有随机性的物体 - 当任意的高熵的随机性物质被吞入黑洞的事件视界后，黑洞的熵增大，且大于被其吞噬的物质)

        - Bekenstein assumed that black holes are [[maximum entropy object]]s—that they [have more entropy than anything else] [in the same volume]. In a sphere of radius R, the entropy in a [[relativistic gas]] increases [as the energy increases]. [The only known limit is] gravitational; [when there is too much energy] the gas [collapses into a black hole](((4yVoRAzZf))). Bekenstein used this to put an [[upper bound]] on the entropy [in a region of space], and [the bound was proportional to] [the area of the region]. He concluded that the [[black hole entropy]] is directly proportional to [the area of the event horizon].[10] 
            - [[gravitational time dilation]] 膨胀/扩张 causes time, [from the perspective of] a [[remote observer]], to stop at the event horizon. Due to the [natural limit] on [maximum speed of motion], this prevents [falling objects] from [crossing the event horizon] [no matter how close they get to it]. Since any change in quantum state [requires time to flow], all objects and their [quantum information state] [stay imprinted on the event horizon]. Bekenstein concluded that from the perspective of any remote observer, the black hole entropy is [directly proportional to] [the area of the event horizon].

220129-20:28
        - Stephen Hawking [had shown earlier that] the total [[horizon area]] of [a collection of black holes] [always increases with time]. The horizon is a boundary defined by [[light-like geodesic]]s; it is those [[light ray]]s that are just [barely unable to escape]. If [neighboring geodesics] [start moving toward each other] they [eventually collide], at which point their extension is [inside the black hole]. So the geodesics are always [moving apart], and [the number of geodesics] which [generate the boundary], the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking's result was called [the second law of black hole thermodynamics](((bgcguOkLH))), by analogy with [the law of entropy increase](((6jUysxvZP))), but at first, he [did not take the analogy too seriously].

            - Hawking knew that if the horizon area were [an actual entropy], black holes [would have to radiate](((qUmI6Te6S))). [When heat is added to] a [[thermal system]], [the change in entropy] is the increase in mass-energy divided by temperature:
$$\mathrm{d} S=\frac{\rm {\delta }M c^{2}}{T}$$.
                - (Here the term $$\rm {\delta }M c^{2}$$ is [substituted for](((BhOF9A9X_))) the [[thermal energy]] [added to the system], generally by [non-integrable random processes](((U52AehBuu))), 通常由不可积随机过程产生 in contrast to dS, which is a function of a few "[[state variable]]s" only, i.e. 也就是 in [conventional thermodynamics] only of the [[Kelvin temperature]] T and a few [additional state variables] as, e.g., the pressure.)

                - If black holes have a [finite entropy], [they should also have] a [finite temperature]. In particular, they would [come to equilibrium]([[thermal equilibrium]]) with a [thermal gas of photons](((aodnHMhfh))). This means that black holes would not only [absorb photons], [but they would also have to] [emit them in the right amount] to [maintain detailed balance].

            - [Time-independent solutions](((ZVZkuj5U-))) to [[field equation]]s do not [emit radiation](((dkZTrHmgp))), because a [time-independent background] [conserves energy]. Based on this principle, Hawking [set out to show that] [black holes do not radiate]. But, to his surprise, a [careful analysis] [convinced him that] they do, and [in just the right way to] come to equilibrium [with a gas at a finite temperature]. [Hawking's calculation] fixed [the constant of proportionality] at 1/4; the entropy of a black hole is one quarter its horizon area [in Planck units].[11]
220130-09:57
                - The entropy is proportional to the logarithm of [the number of microstates]([[microstate]]), the [enumerated ways] a system can be [configured microscopically](((K0gUEGMkY))) 进行微观配置的列举方式 [while leaving the macroscopic description unchanged](((QS33ZVCnw))). 在宏观描述不变的情况下 Black hole entropy is [deeply puzzling] – it says that the logarithm of [the number of states of] a black hole is [proportional to the area of the horizon], not [the volume in the interior].[12]
220130-10:40
            - Later, Raphael Bousso came up with [a covariant version of the bound] based upon [null sheets].[13]
- [Black hole information paradox]([[black hole information paradox]])
    - [Hawking's calculation] suggested that [the radiation which black holes emit] is [not related in any way to] [the matter that they absorb]. [The outgoing light rays] [start exactly at the edge of the black hole] and [spend a long time near the horizon], while [the infalling matter] [only reaches the horizon much later]. [The infalling and outgoing mass/energy interact] [only when they cross]. [It is implausible that] the [outgoing state] [would be completely determined by] [some tiny residual scattering].[citation needed] 残余散射
(黑洞释放辐射量与其吸收辐射无关-射出的辐射和陷入黑洞的辐射尽在相交时才会有相互作用)
211225-19:49
        - [Hawking interpreted this to mean that] when [[black hole]]s [absorb some photons] in a [[pure state]] described by a [[wave function]], they [re-emit new photons] in a [[thermal mixed state]] described by a [[density matrix]]. [This would mean that] quantum mechanics [would have to be modified] because, in quantum mechanics, [states which are superpositions with](((PV4WEEVrV))) [[probability amplitude]]s [never become] states which are [probabilistic mixtures of different possibilities].[note 1]

(黑洞吸收的光子是纯态的，重新释放的光子则是由密度矩阵描述的热混合态 - 量子力学中，态叠加是对概率幅的叠加，不是不同概率的概率性混合)
    - Troubled by this paradox, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] analyzed the emission of [[Hawking radiation]] [in more detail].[14][self-published source?] He noted that when Hawking radiation escapes, there is a way in which [incoming particles] can modify the [outgoing particles]. Their [[gravitational field]] would deform [the horizon of the black hole]([[event horizon]]), and the [deformed horizon](((NKzJR1wJI))) could [produce different outgoing particles] than the [undeformed horizon]. When a particle [falls into a black hole], [it is boosted] [relative to an outside observer]([[outside observer]]), and its gravitational field [assumes a universal form]. 
        - 't Hooft showed that this field makes [a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump] 帐篷杆状凸起 [on the horizon of a black hole], and like a shadow, the bump is an [alternative description] of [the particle's location and mass]. For [a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole], [the deformation of the horizon](((NKzJR1wJI))) is [similar to the type of deformation which describes] [the emission and absorption of particles] on a string-theory [[world sheet]]. Since [the deformations on the surface] are [the only imprint of the incoming particle], and since these deformations would have to [completely determine] the outgoing particles, 't Hooft believed that the [correct description] of the black hole would be [by some form of string theory].

220130-16:15, 16:30
        - [This idea was made more precise by] [[Leonard Susskind]], who had also been developing [[holography]], largely independently. Susskind argued that [the oscillation of the horizon of a black hole] is [a complete description of] [both the infalling and outgoing matter][note 2], because the [world-sheet theory](((Y0XB0-mYP))) of string theory was just such a [holographic description]. While [[short string]]s have [[zero entropy]], he could identify [long highly excited string states](((unwxx3mr7))) with [ordinary black holes]. **This was [a deep advance] because it revealed that strings have a** [[classical interpretation]] [in terms of black holes].

220130-16:38
            - [This work showed that] the black hole information paradox is resolved when [[quantum gravity]] is described in [an unusual string-theoretic way] assuming the [string-theoretical description] is complete, unambiguous and non-redundant.[16] 明确且无冗余 The [[space-time]] in quantum gravity would emerge as [an effective description of] the theory of oscillations of [a lower-dimensional black-hole horizon], and suggest that any black hole [with appropriate properties], not just strings, would [serve as a basis for] [a description of string theory].
(量子引力中的时空作为低维黑洞视界的振荡的一种有效描述而演生出来-弦论的基础也不再限定于弦，而是任意满足特定条件的黑洞)
    - In 1995, Susskind, [along with collaborators] Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, and Stephen Shenker, [presented a formulation of] the new [[M-theory]] using a [[holographic description]] in terms of [charged point black holes](((gvXNQLUQ7))), the [[D0 brane]]s of [[type IIA string theory]]. The [matrix theory] they proposed [was first suggested as a description of] two [[brane]]s in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] by Bernard de Wit, Jens Hoppe, and Hermann Nicolai. The [later authors] reinterpreted the same [matrix models] [as a description of] the [[dynamics]] of [[point black hole]]s [in particular limits]. 
        - Holography [allowed them to conclude that] [the dynamics of these black holes] give [a complete non-perturbative formulation](((0DHt3dhoR))) of M-theory. In 1997, Juan Maldacena gave the first [holographic descriptions] of a [higher-dimensional object](((d2fbPVWPp))), the 3+1-dimensional type IIB membrane, which resolved [a long-standing problem] of finding a [string description] which describes a [[gauge theory]]. These developments [simultaneously explained] [how string theory is related to] some forms of [supersymmetric quantum field theories](((py-7boV_Z))).

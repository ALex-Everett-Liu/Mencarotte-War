- The holographic principle is [a tenet of string theories]([[string theory]]) and [a supposed property of quantum gravity] that states that the description of [a volume of space] [can be thought of as] [encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region]—such as a [[light-like boundary]] like a [[gravitational horizon]]. First proposed by [[Gerard 't Hooft]], it was given [a precise string-theory interpretation] by [[Leonard Susskind]],[1] who [combined his ideas with] [previous ones] of 't Hooft and [[Charles Thorn]]. [1][2]

    - Leonard Susskind said, “The [three-dimensional world] of [ordinary experience]––the universe [filled with galaxies], stars, planets, houses, boulders, and people––is a [[hologram]], [an image of reality] [cited on a distant two-dimensional (2D) surface]."[3] [As pointed out by] Raphael Bousso,[4] Thorn observed in 1978 that string theory admits [a lower-dimensional description] in which [gravity emerges from it] [in what would now be called] [a holographic way]. [The prime example of] holography is the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].

- The holographic principle was inspired by [[black hole thermodynamics]], [which conjectures that](((irHwhxIRq))) the [[maximal entropy]] [in any region] [scales with the radius squared], and [not cubed] [as might be expected]. In the case of a black hole, [the insight was that] the [informational content] of [all the objects] that [have fallen into the hole] [might be entirely contained in] [[surface fluctuation]]s of the [[event horizon]]. The holographic principle resolves the [[black hole information paradox]] [within the framework of] string theory.[3]

    - However, there exist [classical solutions] to the [[Einstein equations]] that allow [values of the entropy] [larger than those allowed by] an [[area law]], hence [in principle larger than those of] a black hole. These are the so-called "[[Wheeler's bags of gold]]". [The existence of such solutions] conflicts with the [holographic interpretation], and [their effects in] a [quantum theory of gravity] including the holographic principle are [not fully understood yet].[5]

    - Sabine Hossenfelder has demonstrated that the holographic principle is compatible with [Loop Quantum Gravity]([[loop quantum gravity]]) as well.[6]
- The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]
    - The [anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence], 共形场论 sometimes called [[Maldacena duality]] or [[gauge/gravity duality]], is [a conjectured relationship between] [two kinds of physical theories](((XgmY0O5Sj))). On one side are [[anti-de Sitter space (AdS)]]s which are used in theories of [[quantum gravity]], [formulated in terms of] [[string theory]] or [[M-theory]]. On the other side of the correspondence are [conformal field theories (CFT)]([[conformal field theory (CFT)]]) which are [quantum field theories]([[quantum field theory]]), [including theories similar to] the [Yang–Mills theories]([[Yang–Mills theory]]) that describe [[elementary particle]]s.

    - The duality represents [a major advance in our understanding of] string theory and quantum gravity.[7] This is because it provides a [non-perturbative formulation](((314Snblzm))) of string theory [with certain boundary conditions]([[boundary condition]]) and because it is [the most successful realization of] the holographic principle.
220127-23:43
    - It also [provides a powerful toolkit for] studying [strongly coupled](((SPZQAFDsa))) quantum field theories.[8] [Much of the usefulness of] the duality [results from the fact that] it is a [[strong-weak duality]]: when the fields of the quantum field theory are [strongly interacting](((SPZQAFDsa))), the ones in the [[gravitational theory]] are [weakly interacting] and thus [more mathematically tractable]. [This fact has been used to] [study many aspects of] [nuclear and condensed matter physics] by [translating problems in those subjects into] [more mathematically tractable problems] in string theory.

    - The AdS/CFT correspondence was [first proposed by] [[Juan Maldacena]] in late 1997. [Important aspects of] the correspondence were [elaborated in articles by] Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov, and Alexander Markovich Polyakov, and by Edward Witten. By 2015, Maldacena's article [had over 10,000 citations], becoming [the most highly cited article](((uAP2WoJYY))) [in the field of] [[high energy physics]].[9]
- [Black hole entropy]([[black hole entropy]])
    - An object [with relatively high entropy](((gOE3b7p-n))) is [microscopically random](((Fiiu8kM5p))), like a [hot gas]. [A known configuration of] [[classical field]]s has [[zero entropy]]: [there is nothing random about] [electric and magnetic fields], or gravitational waves. Since black holes are [exact solutions] of [[Einstein's equation]]s, [they were thought not to have] any entropy either.

        - But [[Jacob Bekenstein]] noted that this [leads to a violation of] [[the second law of thermodynamics]]. If one throws [a hot gas with entropy]([[hot gas]]) into a black hole, once it crosses the [[event horizon]], the entropy would disappear. The [random properties](((Fiiu8kM5p))) of the gas [would no longer be seen] [once the black hole had absorbed the gas] and settled down. One way of [salvaging the second law] is if black holes are in fact [random objects with an entropy] that [increases by an amount greater than] [the entropy of the consumed gas].

        - Bekenstein assumed that black holes are [[maximum entropy object]]s—that they [have more entropy than anything else] [in the same volume]. In a sphere of radius R, the entropy in a [[relativistic gas]] increases [as the energy increases]. [The only known limit is] gravitational; [when there is too much energy] the gas [collapses into a black hole](((4yVoRAzZf))). Bekenstein used this to put an [[upper bound]] on the entropy [in a region of space], and [the bound was proportional to] [the area of the region]. He concluded that the [[black hole entropy]] is directly proportional to [the area of the event horizon].[10] 
            - [[gravitational time dilation]] 膨胀/扩张 causes time, [from the perspective of] a [[remote observer]], to stop at the event horizon. Due to the [natural limit] on [maximum speed of motion], this prevents [falling objects] from [crossing the event horizon] [no matter how close they get to it]. Since any change in quantum state [requires time to flow], all objects and their [quantum information state] [stay imprinted on the event horizon]. Bekenstein concluded that from the perspective of any remote observer, the black hole entropy is [directly proportional to] [the area of the event horizon].

        - Stephen Hawking [had shown earlier that] the total [[horizon area]] of [a collection of black holes] [always increases with time]. The horizon is a boundary defined by [[light-like geodesic]]s; it is those [[light ray]]s that are just [barely unable to escape]. If [neighboring geodesics] [start moving toward each other] they [eventually collide], at which point their extension is [inside the black hole]. So the geodesics are always [moving apart], and [the number of geodesics] which [generate the boundary], the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking's result was called [the second law of black hole thermodynamics](((bgcguOkLH))), by analogy with [the law of entropy increase](((6jUysxvZP))), but at first, he [did not take the analogy too seriously].

            - Hawking knew that if the horizon area were [an actual entropy], black holes [would have to radiate](((qUmI6Te6S))). [When heat is added to] a [[thermal system]], [the change in entropy] is the increase in mass-energy divided by temperature:
$$\mathrm{d} S=\frac{\rm {\delta }M c^{2}}{T}$$.
                - (Here the term $$\rm {\delta }M c^{2}$$ is [substituted for](((BhOF9A9X_))) the [[thermal energy]] [added to the system], generally by [non-integrable random processes](((U52AehBuu))), 通常由不可积随机过程产生 in contrast to dS, which is a function of a few "[[state variable]]s" only, i.e. 也就是 in [conventional thermodynamics] only of the [[Kelvin temperature]] T and a few [additional state variables] as, e.g., the pressure.)

- [Black hole information paradox]([[black hole information paradox]])
    - [Hawking's calculation] suggested that [the radiation which black holes emit] is [not related in any way to] [the matter that they absorb]. [The outgoing light rays] [start exactly at the edge of the black hole] and [spend a long time near the horizon], while [the infalling matter] [only reaches the horizon much later]. [The infalling and outgoing mass/energy interact] [only when they cross]. [It is implausible that] the [outgoing state] [would be completely determined by] [some tiny residual scattering].[citation needed] 残余散射

    - [Hawking interpreted this to mean that] when [[black hole]]s [absorb some photons] in a [[pure state]] described by a [[wave function]], they [re-emit new photons] in a [[thermal mixed state]] described by a [[density matrix]]. [This would mean that] quantum mechanics [would have to be modified] because, in quantum mechanics, [states which are superpositions with](((PV4WEEVrV))) [[probability amplitude]]s [never become] states which are [probabilistic mixtures of different possibilities].[note 1]

- How to [Remove DC Offset] before [Performing FFT]
- Origin Blog - Sharing tips and ideas about [[OriginLab]]
- [Performing FFT to a signal]([[fast Fourier transform (FFT)]]) with a large [[DC offset]] [would often result in] a big [[impulse]] [around frequency 0 Hz], thus [masking out the signals of interests with] [relatively small amplitude]([[amplitude]]). 遮蔽

    - Origin [provides two methods to] remove DC offset from the [[original signal]] [before performing FFT]:
        - Using FFT High-Pass Filter
        - [Subtracting the Mean of] [Original Signal]
    - Note that [these two methods] [can get the same result]. You can also not [filter the input], but [set zero to] the [zero frequency point] for [FFT result].

    - All books → Quick help
    - Two methods to remove DC offset from the original signal before performing FFT:
        - Use FFT high-pass filter
            - Highlight the source signal column, and select menu **Analysis: Signal Processing: FFT Filters**.
            - In the pop-up dialog, choose **High Pass** for **Filter Type**, set **Cutoff Frequency** to zero and clear the **Keep DC offset** check-box.
            - Click OK button to get the result without DC offset.

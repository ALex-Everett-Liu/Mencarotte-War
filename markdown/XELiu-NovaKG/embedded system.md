- An embedded system is a [computer system]—a combination of a [[computer processor]], [[computer memory]], and [[input/output peripheral device]]s—that [has a dedicated function] 专用功能 within [a larger mechanical or electronic system].[1][2] It is embedded [as part of a complete device] often including [[electrical hardware]] or [[electronic hardware]] and [mechanical parts]. Because an embedded system typically [controls physical operations of the machine] that it is embedded within, it often has [[real-time computing constraint]]s. Embedded systems [control many devices] [in common use today].[3] In 2009 [it was estimated that] ninety-eight percent of all [[microprocessor]]s manufactured were used in embedded systems.[4]

    - Modern embedded systems are often based on [[microcontroller]]s (i.e. microprocessors with [[integrated memory]] and [[peripheral interface]]s), but [ordinary microprocessors] (using [[external chip]]s for memory and [peripheral interface circuits](((U_LzUGO2_)))) are also common, especially in [more complex systems]. In either case, the processor(s) used [may be types ranging from] [general purpose] to those [specialized in a certain class of computations], or even [custom designed for] [the application at hand]. A [common standard class] of [dedicated processors] is the [[digital signal processor (DSP)]].

    - Since the embedded system is dedicated to [[specific task]]s, [design engineers] can optimize it to [[reduce the size]] and [[reduce the cost]] of the product and increase the [[reliability]] and [[performance]]. Some embedded systems are [[mass-produced]], benefiting from [[economies of scale]].
    - Embedded systems range from [[portable device]]s such as [[digital watch]]es and [[MP3 player]]s, to [large stationary installations] 大型固定装置 like [[traffic light controller]]s, [[programmable logic controller]]s, and [large complex systems] like [[hybrid vehicle]]s, [[medical imaging system]]s, and [[avionics]]. Complexity varies from low, with a single [[microcontroller chip]], to very high [with multiple units], peripherals and networks mounted inside a [large equipment rack]. 安装在[大型设备机架]内的[外围设备]和网络

- ## History
    - ### Background
        - See also: Microprocessor chronology
        - The origins of the [[microprocessor]] and the [[microcontroller]] [can be traced back to] the [[MOS integrated circuit]], which is an [integrated circuit chip] fabricated from MOSFETs ([metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors]([[metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)]])) and [was developed in] the early 1960s. By 1964, [MOS chips] had reached higher [[transistor density]] and lower [[manufacturing cost]]s than [[bipolar chip]]s. [[MOS chip]]s [further increased in complexity] at a rate predicted by [[Moore's Law]], leading to large-scale integration (LSI) with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to computing was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete computer processor system could be contained on several MOS LSI chips.[5]
        - The first multi-chip microprocessors, the Four-Phase Systems AL1 in 1969 and the Garrett AiResearch MP944 in 1970, were developed with multiple MOS LSI chips. The first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971. It was developed by Federico Faggin, using his silicon-gate MOS technology, along with Intel engineers Marcian Hoff and Stan Mazor, and Busicom engineer Masatoshi Shima.[6]

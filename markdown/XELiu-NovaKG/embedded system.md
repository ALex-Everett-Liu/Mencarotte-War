- An embedded system is a [computer system]—a combination of a [[computer processor]], [[computer memory]], and [[input/output peripheral device]]s—that [has a dedicated function] 专用功能 within [a larger mechanical or electronic system].[1][2] It is embedded [as part of a complete device] often including [[electrical hardware]] or [[electronic hardware]] and [mechanical parts]. Because an embedded system typically [controls physical operations of the machine] that it is embedded within, it often has [[real-time computing constraint]]s. Embedded systems [control many devices] [in common use today].[3] In 2009 [it was estimated that] ninety-eight percent of all [[microprocessor]]s manufactured were used in embedded systems.[4]

    - Modern embedded systems are often based on [[microcontroller]]s (i.e. microprocessors with [[integrated memory]] and [[peripheral interface]]s), but [ordinary microprocessors] (using [[external chip]]s for memory and [peripheral interface circuits](((U_LzUGO2_)))) are also common, especially in [more complex systems]. In either case, the processor(s) used [may be types ranging from] [general purpose] to those [specialized in a certain class of computations], or even [custom designed for] [the application at hand]. A [common standard class] of [dedicated processors] is the [[digital signal processor (DSP)]].

    - Since the embedded system is dedicated to [[specific task]]s, [design engineers] can optimize it to [[reduce the size]] and [[reduce the cost]] of the product and increase the [[reliability]] and [[performance]]. Some embedded systems are [[mass-produced]], benefiting from [[economies of scale]].
- Embedded systems range from portable devices such as digital watches and MP3 players, to large stationary installations like traffic light controllers, programmable logic controllers, and large complex systems like hybrid vehicles, medical imaging systems, and avionics. Complexity varies from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, peripherals and networks mounted inside a large equipment rack.

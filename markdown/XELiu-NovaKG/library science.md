- Library science ([often termed] library studies, bibliothecography, library economy, and [[informatics]])[note 1] is an [[interdisciplinary field]] or [[multidisciplinary field]] that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of management, [[information technology]], education, and other areas to libraries; the collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of [[information resource]]s; and the [[political economy]] of information. Martin Schrettinger, a [[Bavarian]] [[librarian]], [coined the discipline] [within his work] (1808–1828) __Versuch eines vollständigen Lehrbuchs der Bibliothek-Wissenschaft oder Anleitung zur vollkommenen Geschäftsführung eines Bibliothekars__.[1] (Attempt a complete or full [[textbook]] of library science or a perfect librarian guide (instructions for [perfect management of] librarian)) Rather than classifying information based on nature-oriented elements, as was previously done in his Bavarian library, Schrettinger organized books in alphabetical order.[2] The first American school for library science was founded by Melvil Dewey at Columbia University in 1887.[3][4]

- Abstract 
    - The [[French Revolution]] [gave rise to] the [[metric system]], and this has [spread around the world], replacing most [customary units of measure]. In most systems, length (distance), mass, and time are [[base quantities]].
    - [Later science developments] showed that either [[electric charge]] or [[electric current]] [could be added] to extend [the set of base quantities] by which many other [[metrological unit]]s [could be easily defined]. (However, [[electrical unit]]s are not necessary for such a set. [[Gaussian unit]]s, for example, have only length, mass, and time as base quantities, and the [[ampere]] is [defined in terms of] other units.) Other quantities, such as power and speed, are [derived from the base set]: for example, speed is distance per [[unit time]]. 
        - Historically [a wide range of] units was used for [the same type of quantity]: in different contexts, length was measured in [[inch]]es, [[feet]], yards, fathoms, rods, chains, furlongs, miles, nautical miles, stadia, leagues, with conversion factors which were not powers of ten. 换算系数不是10的幂 Such arrangements were satisfactory [in their own contexts]. 足够精确, 充分

- The origins of [optical technology] [date back to remote antiquity]. Exodus 38:8 (ca. 1200 B.C.E.) recounts how Bezaleel, while [preparing the ark and tabernacle], 约柜和帐幕 recast “the [looking-glasses] of the women” into a [brass laver] (a [ceremonial basin]). 重铸成一个黄铜盆 (仪式盆） [Early mirrors]([[mirror]]) were made of [[polished copper]], 抛光铜 [[bronze]], and later on of [[speculum]], 窥镜 a [copper alloy rich in tin]. 富含锡的铜合金 [Specimens]([[specimen]]) 样品, 标本 have survived from ancient Egypt—a mirror [in perfect condition] was unearthed along with some tools from the [workers’ quarters] 工人宿舍 near [the pyramid of Sesostris II] (ca. 1900 b.c.e.) in the [Nile valley]. The Greek philosophers Pythagoras, Democritus, Empedocles, Plato, Aristotle, and others developed several theories of the nature of light. The rectilinear propagation of light (p. 99) was known, as was the Law of Reflection (p. 105) enunciated by Euclid (300 b.c.e.) in his book Catoptrics. Hero of Alexandria attempted to explain both these phenomena by asserting that light traverses the shortest allowed path between two points. The burning glass (a positive lens used to start fires) was alluded to by Aristophanes in his comic play The Clouds (424 b.c.e.).

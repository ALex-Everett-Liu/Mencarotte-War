- [[Modbus RTU]]
- ---
- Modbus is a data [[communications protocol]] [originally published by] Modicon (now [[Schneider Electric]]) in 1979 for use with its [[programmable logic controller (PLC)]]s. Modbus has become a [[de facto standard]] communication protocol and is now [a commonly available means of] connecting [industrial electronic devices](((bfAGbtilL))).[1]

    - Modbus is popular in [[industrial environment]]s because it is [openly published] and [[royalty-free]]. It was developed for [[industrial application]]s, is [relatively easy to] [[deploy]] and [[maintain]] [compared to other standards], and [places few restrictions on] 几乎没有限制 [the format of the data to be transmitted]([[data format]]).

    - The Modbus protocol uses character serial communication lines, Ethernet, or the Internet protocol suite as a transport layer.
    - Modbus supports communication to and from multiple devices connected to the same cable or Ethernet network. For example, there can be a device that measures temperature and another device to measure humidity connected to the same cable, both communicating measurements to the same computer, via Modbus.
    - Modbus is often used to connect a plant/system supervisory computer with a remote terminal unit (RTU) in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in the electric power industry. Many of the data types are named from industrial control of factory devices, such as ladder logic because of its use in driving relays: A single physical output is called a coil, and a single physical input is called a discrete input or a contact.
    - The development and update of Modbus protocols have been managed by the Modbus Organization[2] since April 2004, when Schneider Electric transferred rights to that organization.[3] The Modbus Organization is an association of users and suppliers of Modbus-compliant devices that advocates for the continued use of the technology.[4] Modbus Organization, Inc. is a trade association for the promotion and development of Modbus protocol.[2]

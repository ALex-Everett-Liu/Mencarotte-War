- In string theory, a [[worldsheet]] is a [[two-dimensional manifold]] which [describes the embedding of a string] in [[spacetime]].[1] The term was coined by [[Leonard Susskind]] around 1967[citation needed] as [a direct generalization of] the [[world line]] concept for a [[point particle]] in [special and general relativity].

- The type of string, the geometry of the spacetime in which it propagates, and the presence of long-range background fields (such as gauge fields) are encoded in a two-dimensional conformal field theory defined on the worldsheet. For example, the bosonic string in 26 dimensions has a worldsheet conformal field theory consisting of 26 free scalar bosons. Meanwhile, a superstring worldsheet theory in 10 dimensions consists of 10 free scalar fields and their fermionic superpartners.

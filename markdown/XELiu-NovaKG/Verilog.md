- Verilog, standardized as [IEEE 1364], is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model [[electronic system]]s. It is [most commonly used in] the [design and verification] of [[digital circuit]]s at the [[register-transfer level (RTL)]] of [[abstraction level]]. [It is also used in] the [[verification]] of [[analog circuit]]s and [[mixed-signal circuit]]s, as well as in the design of [[genetic circuit]]s.[1] In 2009, the Verilog standard (IEEE 1364-2005) was [merged into] the [SystemVerilog standard], creating [IEEE Standard 1800-2009]. Since then, Verilog is officially part of the [[SystemVerilog]] language. The [[current version]] is [IEEE standard 1800-2017].[2]

- Overview
    - Hardware description languages such as Verilog are similar to [software programming languages] because they [include ways of describing] the [[propagation time]] and [[signal strength]]s ([[sensitivity]]). There are two types of [[assignment operator]]s; a [[blocking assignment]] (=), and a [[non-blocking assignment]] (<=). The non-blocking assignment [allows designers to describe] a [[state-machine update]] [without needing to declare and use] [[temporary storage variable]]s. Since these concepts are part of Verilog's language [[semantics]], designers [could quickly write] [descriptions of large circuits] [in a relatively compact and concise form]. At the time of Verilog's introduction (1984), Verilog [represented a tremendous productivity improvement] for [circuit designers] who were already using [graphical schematic capture software]([[schematic capture]]) and [specially written software programs] to [document and simulate] [[electronic circuit]]s.

    - The designers of Verilog [wanted a language with syntax similar to] the [[C programming language]], which was [already widely used in] [engineering software development]. Like C, Verilog is [[case-sensitive]] and has a basic [[preprocessor]] (though [less sophisticated than] that of [ANSI C/C++]). Its [[control flow]] keywords (if/else, for, while, case, etc.) are equivalent, and its [[operator precedence]] is [compatible with C]. [Syntactic differences] include: [required bit-widths] for [[variable declaration]]s, [demarcation of procedural blocks] 程序块的划分 (Verilog uses begin/end instead of [[curly brace]]s {}), and many other [minor differences]. Verilog requires that variables [be given a definite size]. In C these sizes are inferred from [the 'type' of the variable] (for instance an [integer type] may be 8 bits).

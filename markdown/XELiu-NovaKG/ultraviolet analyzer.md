- **Ultraviolet Analyzer**Â is a [radiant energy analyzer](http://www.solidswiki.com/index.php?title=Ultraviolet_Analyzers) that uses [ultraviolet region](((SG-jAoXKF))) of the [electromagnetic radiation spectrum](((zpFkRUq9R))). This region [consists of wavelengths from] 100 to 400 microns. [Chemical analysis] is frequently achieved by [absorption spectrophotometry](((2s4oiKHPm))) in which [radiation of different wavelengths] is [passed through a material], and the radiation transmitted, absorbed, is measured to [determine material identity and concentration]. This technique is used in the ultraviolet, infrared, X-ray and [similar regions], it usually [surveys all the wavelengths in] the UV or IR region, or at least [in the region of interest], __and [plots the absorption vs wavelength].__

    - An [UV analyzer](http://www.solidswiki.com/index.php?title=File:Ultraviolet_Analyzers.jpg) [can be expected to be] [less specific than] an [IR analyzer](((zdes9Iq0x))). And, UV analyzers are generally capable of more sensitivity than their IR counterparts - trace analyses are common for UV. Samples may be gas or liquid, but the sample must be relatively free of dirt and must be in a single phase. Trace measurements are possible. As for liquid samples, vapor bubbles cannot be tolerated because they generate noise in the optical reading. If a pressurized cell is used on a gas sample, the cell pressure must be maintained constant.

- And on that wave
we will all have to navigate,
all who are nourished
by the fruits of the Earth. (II, 14) 滋养
- ### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS?
    - For millennia before clocks, our only [regular way] of [measuring time] had been [the alternation of day and night](((GRWzUgz8S))). [The rhythm of day followed by night] also [regulates the lives of plants and animals]. [Diurnal rhythms](((v8hwAeHGb))) are ubiquitous [in the natural world]. They are essential to life, and [it seems to me probable that] they [played a key role in] [the very origin of life on Earth], since [an oscillation is required to] [set a mechanism in motion]. [Living organisms] are [full of clocks of various kinds]—molecular, neuronal, chemical, hormonal—[each of them more or less] [in tune with the others]. 41 There are [chemical mechanisms] that [keep to a twenty-four-hour rhythm even] [in the biochemistry of single cells].

    - Aristotle is [the first we are aware of] to have [asked himself the question] “What is time?,” and he [came to the following conclusion]: time is [the measurement of change]. Things change continually. We call “time” the measurement, the counting of this change.
        - Aristotle’s idea is sound: time is [what we refer to] [when we ask] “when?” “[After how much time] [will you return]?” means “When will you return?” The answer to the question “when?” refers to [something that happens]. “I’ll return in three days’ time” means that [between departure and return] the sun will have [completed three circuits in the sky]. It’s as simple as that.
- ### WHAT IS THERE, WHERE THERE IS NOTHING?
    - Aristotle was the first to [discuss in depth and with acuity] the meaning of “space,” or “place,” and to [arrive at a precise definition]: [the place of a thing] is [what surrounds that thing]. 49
        - As in the case of time, Newton suggests that [we should think differently]. The space defined by Aristotle, [the enumeration of](((0pFTgPxyx))) [what surrounds each thing], is called “relative, apparent, and common” by Newton. He calls “absolute, true, and mathematical” space in itself, which exists [even where there is nothing].

        - The difference between Aristotle and Newton is glaring. For Newton, [between two things] [there may also be] “[[empty space]].” For Aristotle, [it is absurd to speak of] “empty” space, because space is only [the spatial order of things]. If there are no things—their extension, their contacts—there is no space. Newton imagines that things are [situated in a “space”] that [continues to exist], empty, even when divested of things. For Aristotle, this “empty space” is nonsensical, because [if two things do not touch] it means that [there is something else between them], and if there is something, then this something is a thing, and therefore a thing that is there. It cannot be that there is “nothing.”
        - For my part, I find it curious that [both these ways of thinking about] space [originate from our everyday experience](((UdMWxhO3l))). [The difference between them exists due to] [a quirky accident of] [the world in which we live]: the lightness of air, the presence of which we [only barely perceive]. We can say: I see a table, a chair, a pen, the ceiling—and that between myself and the table [there is nothing]. Or [we can say that] [between one and another of these things] there is air. Sometimes we speak of air as if it were something, sometimes as if it were nothing. Sometimes as if it were there, sometimes as if it were not there. We are used to saying “This glass is empty” in order to say that it is full of air. We can consequently think of the world around us as “almost empty,” with just a few objects here and there, or alternatively as “completely full” of air. In the end, Aristotle and Newton do not engage in profound metaphysics: they are only using these two different intuitive and ingenious ways of seeing the world around us—taking or not taking air into account—and transforming them into definitions of space.

we will all have to navigate,
all who are nourished

- ### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS?
    - For millennia before clocks, our only [regular way] of [measuring time] had been [the alternation of day and night](((GRWzUgz8S))). [The rhythm of day followed by night] also [regulates the lives of plants and animals]. [Diurnal rhythms](((v8hwAeHGb))) are ubiquitous [in the natural world]. They are essential to life, and [it seems to me probable that] they [played a key role in] [the very origin of life on Earth], since [an oscillation is required to] [set a mechanism in motion]. [Living organisms] are [full of clocks of various kinds]—molecular, neuronal, chemical, hormonal—[each of them more or less] [in tune with the others]. 41 There are [chemical mechanisms] that [keep to a twenty-four-hour rhythm even] [in the biochemistry of single cells].

we will all have to navigate,

- ### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS?
    - For millennia before clocks, our only [regular way] of [measuring time] had been [the alternation of day and night](((GRWzUgz8S))). [The rhythm of day followed by night] also [regulates the lives of plants and animals]. [Diurnal rhythms](((v8hwAeHGb))) are ubiquitous [in the natural world]. They are essential to life, and [it seems to me probable that] they [played a key role in] [the very origin of life on Earth], since [an oscillation is required to] [set a mechanism in motion]. [Living organisms] are [full of clocks of various kinds]—molecular, neuronal, chemical, hormonal—[each of them more or less] [in tune with the others]. 41 There are [chemical mechanisms] that [keep to a twenty-four-hour rhythm even] [in the biochemistry of single cells].

    - Aristotle is the first we are aware of to have asked himself the question “What is time?,” and he came to the following conclusion: time is the measurement of change. Things change continually. We call “time” the measurement, the counting of this change.
        - Aristotle’s idea is sound: time is what we refer to when we ask “when?” “After how much time will you return?” means “When will you return?” The answer to the question “when?” refers to something that happens. “I’ll return in three days’ time” means that between departure and return the sun will have completed three circuits in the sky. It’s as simple as that.

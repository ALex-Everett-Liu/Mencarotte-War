- **Abstract**
    - [[third-generation synchrotron radiation source]]s [with improving new techniques] [provide opportunities to] [perform many promising experiments]. [[X-ray Raman scattering (XRS)]] is one of the [synchrotron radiation based techniques] for the investigation of [soft X-ray absorption edges] (∼50-1000 eV) using [[hard X-ray]]s (∼10 keV). [This technique allows] the examination of the [K-shell excitations] of [light elements] and [L- and M-shell excitations] of 3__d__ transition metals 三维过渡金属 with bulk-sensitivity.

    - XRS is preferred to conventional soft [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)]] [for complicated sample conditions], since the technique [does not require vacuum]. [Structural and electronic properties] of [rechargable batteries] or [hydrogen storage devices] in operation, inner Earth elements under realistic conditions can be studied, liquids, weakly ordered solids and gas samples can be examined, and ancient/historic materials comprising organic compounds can be discriminated using XRS spectroscopy. In this study, XRS is described briefly and the distinctive applications in different research areas are highlighted.

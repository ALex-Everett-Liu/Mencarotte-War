- The problem of [necessary consensus] is [resolved by]([[resolve the problem]]) [individuals or groups] assembling their own [graph of inferences]([[inference graph]]), based on [[premise]]s or data curated from their [[trusted network]]s. However, collaboration still [requires a mechanism for]([[mechanism]]) [evaluating which ideas are best]. In the same way that individuals [assign weightings]([[assigned weightings]]) to their personal [[prediction]]s and [[decision]]s, groups must be able to ‘[[vote]]’ on the [[merit]]s of [any given idea], [premise], or [piece of evidence](((JLHsxETmJ))). There are [various options] for how these [[collective weightings]] might be calibrated, some of which are [briefly described below].

- a) **Wisdom of crowds**
    - [A diverse collection of people] can [make certain decisions and predictions] much better than [any given individual]([[individual]]): The great [[statistician]] [[Francis Galton]] [was stunned to find that] 惊讶地发现 800 people guessing [the weight of an ox] at a [country fair] 乡下集市 returned an [[average]] that was just one pound shy of the [correct figure]() of 1198 pounds.

    - In other situations, the [[opinion]] of the [[crowd]] bears little relationship to [[objective reality]]. By definition, [[the tyranny of the majority]] will [quash any position that is unpopular]([[unpopular position]]), [regardless of whether it is true]. Often, [[domain-specific knowledge]] may be required; for example, someone who [has not studied] [[free will]] would only be [[adding noise]] by ‘voting’ a [[preference]] for [[compatibilism]], [[hard determinism]], or [[libertarianism]].

    - Simple [[popularity contest]]s 人气竞赛 do not always [move us closer to the truth]([[truth]]), ^^but they are useful in that [they tell us] [what we believe]().^^ This data could potentially be broken down by [[demographic]] to [[demonstrate]] how [[different groups]] [[perceive reality]], and possibly [alert users to] [biases amongst]([[bias]]) their own [[in-group]]s. 多数人的意见当然不是真理（往往是谬论），但它有助于时时提醒我们人们普遍相信着什么，与我们自己的意见有何认同与冲突之处。 #wisdom

- The problem of [necessary consensus] is [resolved by]([[resolve the problem]]) [individuals or groups] assembling their own [graph of inferences]([[inference graph]]), based on [[premise]]s or data curated from their [[trusted network]]s. However, collaboration still [requires a mechanism for]([[mechanism]]) [evaluating which ideas are best]. In the same way that individuals [assign weightings]([[assigned weightings]]) to their personal [[prediction]]s and [[decision]]s, groups must be able to ‘[[vote]]’ on the [[merit]]s of [any given idea], [premise], or [piece of evidence](((JLHsxETmJ))). There are [various options] for how these [[collective weightings]] might be calibrated, some of which are [briefly described below].

- a) **Wisdom of crowds**
    - [A diverse collection of people] can [make certain decisions and predictions] much better than [any given individual]([[individual]]): The great [[statistician]] [[Francis Galton]] [was stunned to find that] 惊讶地发现 800 people guessing [the weight of an ox] at a [country fair] 乡下集市 returned an [[average]] that was just one pound shy of the [correct figure](((P5DRk3U7t))) of 1198 pounds.

        - In 1906, the great statistician Francis Galton observed a [[competition]] to guess the weight of an ox at a country fair. www.[[ftchinese]].com
    - In other situations, the [[opinion]] of the [[crowd]] [bears little relationship to](((gKlULb6UZ))) [[objective reality]]. By definition, [[the tyranny of the majority]] will [quash any position that is unpopular]([[unpopular position]]), [regardless of whether it is true]. Often, [[domain-specific knowledge]] may be required; for example, someone who [has not studied] [[free will]] [would only be adding noise by] ‘voting’ a [[preference]] for [[compatibilism]], [[hard determinism]], or [[libertarianism]].

    - Simple [[popularity contest]]s do not always [move us closer to the truth]([[truth]]), ^^but they are useful in that [they tell us] [what we believe](((gaJhJQIQy))).^^ This data [could potentially be broken down by] [[demographic]] to demonstrate how [different groups] [perceive reality], and possibly [alert users to] [biases amongst]([[bias]]) their own [[in-group]]s. 多数人的意见当然不总是真理（往往是谬论），但它有助于时时提醒我们人们普遍相信着什么，与我们自己的意见有何认同与冲突之处。 #wisdom

- b) **Believability scores**
    - [Hedge fund]([[hedge fund]]) [[manager]] [Ray Dalio] pioneered a [[decision-making system]] at [Bridgewater Associates] that is much closer to [[epistocracy]] than [[democracy]]: The [[opinion]]s of [more “believable” people], who [have repeatedly proven] [their grasp of](((v9jRYmo4d))) a given [[topic]] or [[trait]], 反复证明自己对某一特定主题或特质的掌握 [hold more weight]([[weight]]) than those with lower [[believability score]]s. There is nothing to stop Dalio [being overruled by] his most [[junior]] [[employee]]s, as long are they are [consistently more right than] he is. #autocracy
    - [Implementing a similar system] in Roam would [necessitate the ability to](((7s_-SJk1J))) [[track performance]], perhaps by how much [[original content]] a user has [contributed to the graph] with [[broad support]], or how [well-calibrated](((585ec1IO1))) their [[prediction]]s are.

- c) **Prediction markets**
    - When people succumb to [[peer pressure]] and other [biases], do not have enough [[specialist knowledge]], or [[deliberately]] make [[false prediction]]s, the ‘[[wisdom of the crowd]]’ **can [end up being very wrong].**

    - The insight behind [[prediction market]]s is that [[participant]]s can be incentivised to [[profit]] from any such [[mistake]]s. Wherever someone believes the [[consensus]] is wrong, they can [stake money on it], and [move the probability back]([[probability]]) to a [[better informed position]]. [Insider information]([[insider information]]) is not only permitted, but welcomed. In this way, [vast amounts of information] [can be synthesised into] one [constantly updated]() [[data point]], which is often [remarkably accurate]([[accurate]]).

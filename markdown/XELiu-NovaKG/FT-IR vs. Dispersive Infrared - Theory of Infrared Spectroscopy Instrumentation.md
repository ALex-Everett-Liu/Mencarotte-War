- The [[dispersive infrared spectrometer]] emerged in the 1940’s. This design helped to [spread the use of] [[infrared spectroscopy]] as a common [analytical technique](((1yh92ldCm))) for [organic compound characterization](((pK04gXmle))) in laboratories. [Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometers] were [developed for commercial use] in the 1960’s, but [at that time] [tended to be used for] [advanced research] only. [This was due to] the cost of the [instrument components] and the [large computers] [required to run them]. Gradually, [technology advancements] in computers and instruments [have reduced the cost](((QbKIKNKx7))) and [enhanced the capabilities of] an FT-IR. Today, an [FT-IR instrument] is the standard for [organic compound identification work](((pK04gXmle))) in [modern analytical laboratories].

- ## FT-IR: How Does It Work?
    - An FT-IR instrument uses a system called an [[interferometer]] to [collect a spectrum]. The interferometer consists of a source, [[beamsplitter]], two mirrors, a laser and a detector. [The energy goes from the source to] the beamsplitter which [splits the beam into two parts]. [One part is transmitted to] a [[moving mirror]]; one part is reflected to a [[fixed mirror]]. The moving mirror moves back and forth at a constant velocity. This velocity is timed according to the very precise laser wave- length in the system which also acts as an internal wavelength calibration. The two beams are reflected from the mirrors and recombined at the beamsplitter. The beam from the moving mirror has traveled a different distance than the beam from the fixed mirror. When the beams are combined an interference pattern is created, since some of the wavelengths recombine constructively and some destructively. This interference pattern is called an interferogram. This interferogram then goes from the beamsplitter to the sample, where some energy is absorbed and some is transmitted. The transmitted portion reaches the detector. The detector reads information about every wavelength in the infrared range simultaneously.

- ## Dispersive Infrared Instruments
    - Dispersive infrared instruments are sometimes called [[grating spectrometer]] or [[scanning spectrometer]]s. A dispersive infrared instrument also [has a source and mirrors], but [the similarities to an FT-IR] [end there]. [The source energy is sent through] [both a sample and a reference path], through a [[chopper]] to [moderate the energy] [reaching the detector], and directed to a [[diffraction grating]]. This grating is similar to a [[prism]]. It [separates the wavelengths of light] [in the spectral range] and [directs each wavelength individually through] a [[slit]] to the detector. Each wavelength is [measured one at a time], with the slit monitoring the [[spectral bandwidth]] [and the grating moving to] [select the wavelength being measured]. The x-axis of a dispersive infrared spectrum is typically [[nanometer]]s which can be converted to the FT-IR unit [[wavenumber]]s by [dividing by 10] and [taking the reciprocal]. An [external source] of [[wavelength calibration]] is required, since there is no [high-precision laser wavelength] to [reference in the system].

- ## FT-IR Advantages
    - There are three [major advantages] in the [[performance]] of an FT-IR spectrometer over a dispersive infrared spectrometer. [These advantages have been the reason for] the switch to the more [modern FT-IR technique] [in the last decade] by [infrared spectroscopists].
    - ### Multiplex Advantage
        - An interferometer in an FT-IR instrument does not [separate energy into individual frequencies] for [measurement of the infrared spectrum]. Each point in the [[interferogram]] [contains information from each wavelength of light] being measured. [Every stroke of the moving mirror] 每一下轻挪 in the interferometer equals [one scan of the entire infrared spectrum], and [individual scans] can be combined to [give better representation of] the [actual absorbance of the sample]. In contrast, [every wavelength across the spectrum] [must be measured individually] in a dispersive spectrometer. This is a [slow process], and typically only one measurement scan of the sample is made in a dispersive instrument. The FT-IR advantage is that [many scans can be completed and combined] on an FT-IR [in a shorter time than] [one scan on a dispersive instrument]. The [[multiplex]] advantage results in faster [[data collection]] of an FT-IR spectrum.

    - ### Throughput Advantage
        - An FT-IR instrument does not use a [[slit]] to [limit the individual frequency] [reaching the sample and detector] as a dispersive instrument does. There are also fewer [mirror surfaces] in an FT-IR spectrometer, so there are less [reflection losses] than in a dispersive spectrometer. Overall, [more energy reaches the sample] and hence the detector in an FT-IR spectrometer than in a dispersive spectrometer. [This means that] the [signal-to-noise ratio]([[signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]]) of an infrared spectrum [measured on an FT-IR] is higher than the signal-to-noise ratio attained on a dispersive instrument. Higher signal-to-noise means that the [[sensitivity]] of [small peaks] will be greater, and [details in a sample spectrum] [will be clearer and more distinguishable] in the [FT-IR spectrum] than the dispersive spectrum [of the same sample].

        - In addition, [high-resolution measurement] of infrared spectra is of [higher quality] on an FT-IR system. The slit on a dispersive instrument must [severely limit the amount of energy] [reaching the sample] in order to [measure data points] [spaced closely together] on a [high resolution spectrum], resulting in [poor quality] spectra. [The process is also extremely slow] due to [the coordination of the grating and slit systems] to [collect the large number of data points] required.

    - ### Precision Advantage
        - An FT-IR spectrometer [requires the use of] a [[laser]] to [control the velocity of the moving mirror] and to [time the collection of data points] throughout [the mirror stroke length] for each scan. This laser is also available as a source of [[wavelength calibration]] [within the instrument]. The [laser wavelength] is a [[constant value]], and the [x-axis data points] of the FT-IR spectrum are automatically [referenced to this known value] to [maintain internal precision] and accuracy of the [wavelength positions]. [Spectra collected with an FT-IR spectrometer] [can be compared with confidence] [whether they were collected five minutes or five years apart]. [This capability is not available on] a [dispersive infrared system]. [External calibration standards] are required to [control the accuracy of] a dispersive instrument, making spectra less comparable due to [instrumental unknowns] [during and between scans]. [Accuracy and precision] in infrared spectra are much higher [when collected on an FT-IR].

- ## Summary
    - As discussed here, FT-IR spectrometers are more modern and have numerous [performance advantages] over dispersive instrumentation. [Virtually](((PjtGhT-kW))) all [infrared spectrometer manufacturers] are using [FT designs] instead of dispersive today. [The benefits of upgrading to] an FT-IR from an existing dispersive infrared instrument will be [immediately evident] in [spectral quality], data collection speed, [reproducibility of data] and [ease of maintenance and use].

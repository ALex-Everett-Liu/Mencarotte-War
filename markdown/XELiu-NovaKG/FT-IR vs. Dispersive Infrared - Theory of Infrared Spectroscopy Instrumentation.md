- The dispersive infrared spectrometer emerged in the 1940’s. This design helped to spread the use of infrared spectroscopy as a common analytical technique for organic compound characterization in laboratories. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometers were developed for commercial use in the 1960’s, but at that time tended to be used for advanced research only. This was due to the cost of the instrument components and the large computers required to run them. Gradually, technology advancements in computers and instru- ments have reduced the cost and enhanced the capabilities of an FT-IR. Today, an FT-IR instrument is the standard for organic compound identification work in modern analytical laboratories.

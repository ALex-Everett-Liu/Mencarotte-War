- A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit [designed to be configured by] a customer or a designer [after manufacturing] – hence the term "field-programmable". The [FPGA configuration] is [generally specified using](((bLfPNFRhf))) a [[hardware description language (HDL)]], [FPGA配置][通常使用]硬件描述语言来指定 [similar to that used for] an [[application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)]]. [[circuit diagram]]s were [previously used to] [specify the configuration], [but this is increasingly rare due to] the advent of [[electronic design automation (EDA)]] tools.

    - FPGAs [contain an array of] [[programmable logic block]]s, and a [[hierarchy]] of "[[reconfigurable interconnect]]s" [allowing blocks to be "wired together"], like many [[logic gate]]s that [can be inter-wired in different configurations](((Tvgu6eKw0))). [Logic blocks] [can be configured to] [perform complex combinational functions]([[combinational function]]), or merely [simple logic gates] like [[AND gate]] and [[XOR gate]]. In most FPGAs, logic blocks also include [[memory element]]s, which may be simple [[flip-flop]]s or [more complete blocks of memory].[1] Many FPGAs can be reprogrammed to implement different logic functions, allowing flexible reconfigurable computing as performed in computer software. 
        - FPGAs [have a remarkable role in] [[embedded system]] development [due to their capability to][2] start [system software (SW) development]([[software development]]) simultaneously with [hardware (HW)]([[hardware development]]), enable [[system performance simulation]]s [at a very early phase of the development], and allow various [system partitioning (SW and HW) trials] and iterations before [final freezing of the system architecture]([[system architecture]]). 允许在系统架构最终冻结之前进行各种系统分区试验和迭代

- The Python programming language [has a wide range of] syntactical constructions, standard library functions, and [interactive development environment features]. Fortunately, you can [ignore most of that]; [you just need to learn enough to] [write some handy little programs].
    - You will, however, have to learn some [basic programming concepts] [before you can do anything]. Like a [[wizard]] in training, you might think these concepts [seem arcane and tedious], but with some knowledge and practice, you’ll be able to [command your computer]([[command]]) like a [[magic wand]] and [perform incredible feats]. 一根魔杖 表演不可思议的壮举
- This chapter has a few examples that encourage you to type into the [[interactive shell]], also called the [[REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop)]], which lets you run (or __execute__) Python instructions one at a time and [instantly shows you the results]. Using the interactive shell is [great for learning] what [basic Python instructions] do, so [give it a try] [as you follow along]. You’ll [remember the things you do] much better than [the things you only read].

    - Perhaps [the most interesting addition] is that of a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) for [JavaScript development]. www.[[infoq]].com

- Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)[1] is [the use of various technologies to] control the [[temperature]], [[humidity]], and [purity of the air]([[air purity]]) [in an enclosed space]. [Its goal is to provide] [[thermal comfort]] and acceptable [[indoor air quality]]. [HVAC system design] is a subdiscipline of [[Mechanical Engineering (ME)]], [based on the principles of] [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]], and [[heat transfer]]. "[[refrigeration]]" is sometimes [added to the field's abbreviation as] HVAC&R or HVACR, or "ventilation" is dropped, as in HACR ([as in the designation of] HACR-rated [[circuit breaker]]s).

    - HVAC is [an important part of] [residential structures] such as [single family homes], [[apartment building]]s, hotels, and senior living facilities; medium to [large industrial buildings] and [[office building]]s such as [[skyscraper]]s and hospitals; [[vehicle]]s such as cars, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines; and in [[marine environment]]s, where [safe and healthy building conditions] are [regulated with respect to temperature and humidity], using [[fresh air]] from outdoors.

    - Ventilating or [[ventilation]] (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of [exchanging or replacing air] [in any space] to provide high [[indoor air quality]] which involves [[temperature control]], [[oxygen replenishment]], and removal of [[moisture]], [[odor]]s, smoke, heat, dust, [[airborne bacteria]], carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes [unpleasant smells] and [excessive moisture], introduces outside air, keeps [interior building] [air circulating], 空气环流 and prevents stagnation of the [interior air]. Methods for [ventilating a building] are divided into [mechanical/forced and natural types].[2]

    - [热泵空调][在南方]依旧有[制热功率很低](https://www.zhihu.com/question/437393382/answer/2203911742)的时候。[空调制热]需要从[外机热交换器][抽取热量]，并输送到室内。**然而[当气温低于5℃]且[相对湿度较高]的时候，[室外机吸热]很快就会导致[热交换器上结霜]**，并使[制热功率]和[制热效率][双双下降]，以及制热十分钟，[除霜五分钟]的[尴尬局面]。 #pt8-99.97
        - 而[电暖气][则不存在这个问题]，简单粗暴，把电能[转换成热能]，问题解决。至于说[价格的问题]，除了北方[价格确实便宜一些]，一个[采暖季]一两千之外。在南方的话，如果[家里有老人小孩]需要全屋24小时采暖，那不管是用电暖气，空调，还是[燃气地暖]，每个月[取暖费]可能都要高达一千元多。这时候电暖气[起始价格低]，一个才几百块，这个优点就太明显了。当然了电暖气[也是有缺点的]，那就是依靠[空气自然对流加热]，[制热][其实挺慢的]。
        - [现在市面上大部分]空调其实都[集成了] 1~1.5KW 的[电辅热]，帮助空调度过南方[每年最冷的][那两三个星期]。

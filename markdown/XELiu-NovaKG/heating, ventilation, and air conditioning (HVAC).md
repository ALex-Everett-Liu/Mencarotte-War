- Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)[1] is [the use of various technologies to] control the [[temperature]], [[humidity]], and [purity of the air]([[air purity]]) [in an enclosed space]. [Its goal is to provide] [[thermal comfort]] and acceptable [[indoor air quality]]. [HVAC system design] is a subdiscipline of [[Mechanical Engineering (ME)]], [based on the principles of] [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]], and [[heat transfer]]. "[[refrigeration]]" is sometimes [added to the field's abbreviation as] HVAC&R or HVACR, or "ventilation" is dropped, as in HACR ([as in the designation of] HACR-rated [[circuit breaker]]s).

    - HVAC is [an important part of] [residential structures] such as [single family homes], [[apartment building]]s, hotels, and senior living facilities; medium to [large industrial buildings] and [[office building]]s such as [[skyscraper]]s and hospitals; [[vehicle]]s such as cars, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines; and in [[marine environment]]s, where [safe and healthy building conditions] are [regulated with respect to temperature and humidity], using [[fresh air]] from outdoors.

    - Ventilating or [[ventilation]] (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of [exchanging or replacing air] [in any space] to provide high [[indoor air quality]] which involves [[temperature control]], [[oxygen replenishment]], and removal of [[moisture]], [[odor]]s, smoke, heat, dust, [[airborne bacteria]], carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes [unpleasant smells] and [excessive moisture], introduces outside air, keeps [interior building] [air circulating], 空气环流 and prevents stagnation of the [interior air]. Methods for [ventilating a building] are divided into [mechanical/forced and natural types].[2]

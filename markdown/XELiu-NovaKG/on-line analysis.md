- 在线分析是指采用[自动采样系统]([[automatic sampling]])，将[试样][自动输入分析仪器中][进行连续或间歇连续分析]的分析技术。在线分析、[内线分析]和[外感分析]这3种[分析方式][统称为]在线分析。与经典的[化学分析]或实验室一般的[仪器分析]相比，在线分析具有分析速度快、效率高(每小时可分析几十甚至上百个[样品])、操作简单、[自动化程度]高、[节省人力]以及[试剂用量]等特点，可实现[连续监测]([[continuous monitoring]])和[数据处理计算机化]，消除了[人为产生的误差]。 [1] 
- # [ONLINE ANALYZERS]([[online analyzer]])
    - [Online analysis]([[online analysis]]) using [Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)]([[near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)]]) technology [provides rapid and accurate monitoring of] [key parameters] in refining and fuel blending, [reducing the need for] [time-consuming and costly] [lab analysis].
    - SGS [provides a full suite of] [NIR analyzer services], including [equipment supply and installation], [project start-up] and [technical support] for [in-laboratory application] and [on-line installation]. We [work in close cooperation with] [major equipment suppliers]([[equipment supplier]]).

    - ### WHAT IS NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (NIRS)?
        - Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a [spectroscopic method](((eX1p7g1R7))) that uses the [near-infrared region] of the [electromagnetic spectrum]. It has [wide range of applications] for the [oil and petrochemicals industries](((14AvyinsQ))), including monitoring of:
            - RON, MON, benzene and aromatics content and RVP in reformat rundown streams
            - IBP and FPB, flashpoint, cloudpoint, CFPP in diesel during blending
        - The range of [potential applications] is [constantly growing].
    - ### ADVANTAGES OF NIR ANALYSIS
        - Provides [test results] of [multiple parameters] in just 20 seconds
        - [Reduces the need for] [extensive sample preparation](((CAixTYbUX)))
        - Requires less manpower than conventional lab analysis
        - Eliminates the need for laboratory analysis and associated costs and delays
        - Does not require hardware changes if a product or formula changes
        - [Ideally suited to support] [quality control processes]

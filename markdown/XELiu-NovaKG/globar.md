- A Globar is used as [[thermal light source]] for [[infrared spectroscopy]]. It is a [[silicon carbide (SiC)]] [[rod]] of 5 to 10 mm width and 20 to 50 mm length which is [electrically heated up to](((7k0PYCzld))) 1,000 to 1,650 °C (1,830 to 3,000 °F). [When combined with] a downstream variable [[interference filter]], it [emits radiation] from 4 to 15 micrometres wavelength. Globars are used as thermal light sources for infrared spectroscopy because their [spectral behaviour] [corresponds approximately to] that of a [[Planck radiator]] (i.e. a black body). Alternative [middle-infrared luminous sources] are [[Nernst lamp]]s, [coils of chrome–nickel alloy](((nbCWb7N1w))) or high-pressure [[mercury lamp]]s.

    - The technical term Globar is an English portmanteau word consisting of glow and bar. Hence, the term glowbar is often used synonymously in the English-speaking area (which is an incorrect spelling in the strict sense).
    - The American Resistor Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, had word and lettering Globar registered as a trademark (in a special decorative script font) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on June 30, 1925 (registration number 0200201) and on October 18, 1927 (registration number 0234147). This registration had been renewed for the third time in 1987 (by various companies throughout 60 years).

    - Globar is a [thermal light source] that [emits radiation near the infra red region] of the electromagnetic spectrum. Globar is a [[thermal radiator]], **meaning a solid which is [heated to very high temperatures] to [produce light radiation].**

        - The name ‘globar’ is [simply a combination of] glow and bar, the [[heating element]] in the form of a [[bar]] is heated until it [[glow]]s to [[emit radiation]]. Globar is a [[continuous radiation source]] that [produces a broad, featureless range of wavelengths]. [This article will elaborate on](((eF83IWt47))) the working, construction and applications of globars.

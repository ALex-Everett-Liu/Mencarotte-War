- Elam (/ˈiːləm/; Linear Elamite: Ha-ta-m-ti.jpg hatamti; Cuneiform Elamite: 𒁹𒄬𒆷𒁶𒋾 haltamti; Sumerian: 𒉏𒈠 elam; Akkadian: 𒉏𒈠𒆠 elamtu; Hebrew: עֵילָם ʿēlām; Old Persian: 𐎢𐎺𐎩 hūja)[1][2] was an [[ancient civilization]] [centered in the far west and southwest of modern-day Iran], stretching from the lowlands of what is now Khuzestan and Ilam Province as well as [a small part of southern Iraq]. The modern name Elam stems from the [Sumerian transliteration] elam(a), along with the later Akkadian elamtu, and the Elamite haltamti. [Elamite states] were among the [leading political forces] of the Ancient Near East.[3] In [[classical literature]], Elam was also known as Susiana (US: /ˌsuːʒiˈænə/ UK: /ˌsuːziˈɑːnə/; Ancient Greek: Σουσιανή Sousiānḗ), a name derived from its capital [[Susa]].[4]

    - Elam was part of the [[early urbanization]] of the [[Near East]] during the [[Chalcolithic period]] ([[Copper Age]]). [The emergence of written records]([[written records]]) from around 3000 BC also parallels Sumerian history, where slightly earlier records have been found.[5][6] In the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age), Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau, centered in Anshan, and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands.[7] Its culture played a crucial role during the Persian Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded Elam, when the Elamite language remained among those in official use. Elamite is generally considered a language isolate unrelated to any other languages. In accordance with geographical and archaeological matches, some historians argue that the Elamites comprise a large portion of the ancestors of the modern day Lurs[8] whose language, Luri, split from Middle Persian.

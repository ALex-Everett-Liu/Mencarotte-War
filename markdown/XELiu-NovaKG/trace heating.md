- [Electric heat tracing], [heat tape] or [surface heating], is a system used to [maintain or raise the temperature of] [[pipe]]s and [[vessel]]s using [[heat tracing cable]]s. 伴热电缆 Trace heating [takes the form of] an [[electrical heating element]] run in [physical contact] [along the length of a pipe]. The pipe is usually covered with [[thermal insulation]] 隔热层 to retain [[heat loss]]es from the pipe. [Heat generated by the element] then [maintains the temperature of] the pipe. 
    - Trace heating may be used to [protect pipes from freezing]([[freezing]]), to maintain a constant [[flow temperature]] in [hot water systems], or to maintain [[process temperature]]s for piping that must [transport substances] that [[solidify]] at [[ambient temperature]]s. [Electric trace heating cables]([[electric heat tracing]]) are an alternative to [[steam trace heating]] where steam is [unavailable or unwanted].[2]

    - [self-regulating heat tracing tape](((RCRUxrdFa))) with the [gray end seal] next to a copper [[drain pipe]] with [[insulator]] [wrapped around them]. This protects the pipe from [[freezing]].[1]
- ## Types
    - ### Self regulating
        - [Self-regulating heat tracing tapes](((RCRUxrdFa))) are cable whose [[resistance]] [varies with temperature] - [low resistance] for [temperatures below] the cable [[set point]] and high resistance for [temperatures above] the cable set point. When the cable temperature [reaches the set point] the resistance [reaches a high point] and resulting in [no more heat being supplied].

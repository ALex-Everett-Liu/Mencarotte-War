- [Electric heat tracing], [heat tape] or [surface heating], is a system used to [maintain or raise the temperature of] [[pipe]]s and [[vessel]]s using [[heat tracing cable]]s. 伴热电缆 Trace heating [takes the form of] an [[electrical heating element]] run in [physical contact] [along the length of a pipe]. The pipe is usually covered with [[thermal insulation]] 隔热层 to retain [[heat loss]]es from the pipe. [Heat generated by the element] then [maintains the temperature of] the pipe. 
    - Trace heating may be used to [protect pipes from freezing]([[freezing]]), to maintain a constant [[flow temperature]] in [hot water systems], or to maintain [[process temperature]]s for piping that must [transport substances] that [[solidify]] at [[ambient temperature]]s. [Electric trace heating cables]([[electric heat tracing]]) are an alternative to [[steam trace heating]] where steam is [unavailable or unwanted].[2]

- In physics, the Poynting vector represents the [[directional energy flux]] (the energy transfer [per unit area] [per unit time]) of an [[electromagnetic field]]. The [SI unit]([[International System of Units (SI)]]) of the Poynting vector is the [watt per square metre (W/m2)]. It is named after its discoverer [[John Henry Poynting]] who first derived it in 1884.[1]:132 Oliver Heaviside also [discovered it independently] [in the more general form](((Mj-BJTQrE))) that recognises the freedom of adding the [[curl]] of an arbitrary [[vector field]] 任意向量场的旋度 to the definition.[2] The Poynting vector is used throughout electromagnetics in conjunction with Poynting's theorem, the continuity equation expressing conservation of electromagnetic energy, to calculate the power flow in electric and magnetic fields.

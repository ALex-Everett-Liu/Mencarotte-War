- In physics, the Poynting vector represents the [[directional energy flux]] (the energy transfer [per unit area] [per unit time](((zo8rkgJ6e)))) of an [[electromagnetic field]]. The [SI unit]([[International System of Units (SI)]]) of the Poynting vector is the [watt per square metre (W/m2)](((nWcRFOC0U))). It is named after its discoverer [[John Henry Poynting]] who first derived it in 1884.[1]:132 Oliver Heaviside also [discovered it independently] [in the more general form](((Mj-BJTQrE))) that recognises the freedom of adding the [[curl]] of an arbitrary [[vector field]] 任意向量场的旋度 to the definition.[2] The Poynting vector is used throughout [[electromagnetics]] [in conjunction with] [[Poynting's theorem]], the [[continuity equation]] expressing [conservation]([[energy conservation]]) of [[electromagnetic energy]], to calculate the [[power flow]] [in electric and magnetic fields].

Colours indicate [the strength of the electric field vector] $$\displaystyle E={\sqrt {E_{x}^{2}+E_{z}^{2}}}$$, $$\displaystyle (E_{y}=0)$$, red colours indicate $$\displaystyle E_{z}>0$$, blue colours ![{\displaystyle E_{z}<0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/245bc78b938abc0e7b27b5557d2de4d3cb9787e0). The black arrows show $$\displaystyle (S_{x},S_{z})$$. As E and S [become very large] [in the center of the dipole] they are [limited to a certain value].

- ## Definition
    - In Poynting's [original paper] and [in many textbooks], the Poynting vector is defined as[3][4][5]   
$$\mathbf {S} =\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {H} $$
        - where [[bold letter]]s represent [[Euclidean vector]]s and
E is the [[electric field vector]];
H is the [[magnetic field]]'s [[auxiliary field vector]]. 辅助

        - This expression is often called the __Abraham form__.[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector#cite_note-Kinsler2009-6) The Poynting vector is usually denoted by **S** or **N**. #[[Abraham form]]
        - In the "microscopic" version of [[Maxwell's equations]], [this definition must be replaced by] [a definition in terms of] the electric field E and the magnetic field B (described later in the article).

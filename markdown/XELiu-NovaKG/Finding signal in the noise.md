- As the [[frequency]] of information increases, the world [becomes noisier and noisier]. [Deliberate](((rHdVOmoDJ))) [exposure to noise](((N29G-AWmn))) is a [useful strategy]([[strategy]]) [in specific contexts]([[specific context]]), [as described in] [Chapter 7],  but otherwise [obscures meaning](((GgF_v4Rkk))).[8](((g5ugAxEah))) `{{alias:((1601))8}}` Given we [have a propensity for] [imposing stories and explanations onto] [[randomness]] - the [[narrative fallacy]] - [it is becoming increasingly difficult to] [separate out] [genuine signal] from noise.

    - Just as humans are incapable of [[generating random numbers]], we struggle to [consciously generate random ideas] - to the point where [actively trying to] ‘think differently’ often seems to only further calcify [[existing pattern]]s. Instead of [attempting to brute-force creativity]([[creativity]]), 试图蛮力创造力 the brain [must be confronted with] [[novel stimuli]] 面对新的刺激 in order to [reorganize its perception]([[reorganize the perception]]). [Exposure to] [a certain amount of] [random ‘noise’]([[random noise]]) - [[drug]]s, [[dream]]s, [[meditation]], [Tarot readings], [[mistake]]s - **can [jolt thoughts out of] [well-tracked grooves]** 把思想从井然有序的沟壑中解放出来/颠覆思路 and into [entirely new areas] of idea-space. Typically these [[insight]]s [occur at the juncture of]([[juncture]]) two or more seemingly [[unrelated fields]], [[concept]]s, or [[image]]s. #[[brainstorm]]

- Assume a [[trend]] has a [[signal-to-noise ratio]] of 1:1 on an [[annual basis]] (50% of the data are [[meaningful data]], 50% are [[random data]]). Observing the same data on a [[daily basis]], the [[composition]] changes to 95% noise, 5% signal. [Observing the data hourly] (as [[news hound]]s and [market junkies] do), and it becomes 99.5% random - which is to say, [two hundred times] [more noise than signal].[9](((n87Qayo83)))

- [Institutions] [entrusted with](((h0Jcf2R1u))) [interpreting the data](((OrQXaPWBB))) include the [[media]], [[academia]], and [legislature]. Some [[agent]]s [within these institutions]([[institution]]) deliberately [[obscure the truth]], as demonstrated by ‘[[fake news]]’, [[p-hacking]], and [politicking]. While actively [[malicious behaviour]] is the exception, 即使我们排除掉这些主动恶意行为 even the best-intentioned [[reporter]]s, 善意的 [[researcher]]s and [[analyst]]s [are not immune to] [being fooled by randomness].

- For most people, the problem of [sorting signal from noise] therefore involves finding [trustworthy and accurate] [[secondary source]]s of information. This [[difficult task]] is often frustrated by gated [[scientific journal]]s, as well as [[search engine algorithm]]s increasingly gamed by [[SEO-savvy]] [[content marketer]]s. 被精通搜索引擎优化的产品营销人员所愚弄

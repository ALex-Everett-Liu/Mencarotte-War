- Recently, [Cotoami project](https://github.com/cotoami/cotoami), the successor of Piggydb, [released a new feature] called “Linking Phrases”.
    - As you can see in the [[screenshot]] below, it allows [annotating a connection](((6LPioDuVY))) [when you feel a need for some explanation] of it.

    - I thought about this enhancement when I was working on [[Piggydb]] [some years ago] but [suspected it would just complicate things] [without adding much value]. Piggydb aimed at becoming a simple [[note-taking tool]], not a [modeling tool]. ^^After all, you can [express a labeled relationship] by [adding a node between the two].^^
        - However, I [came up with an idea] of “Horizontal and Vertical Relationships” recently and thought it would become one of the [significant features] in Cotoami.
    - The term “Linking Phrases” is borrowed from Concept Maps, [which I mentioned in the article] [Wiki, Mind maps, Concept maps, and Piggydb](https://piggydb.net/2010/09/24/wiki-mind-maps-concept-maps-and-piggydb/) before. #[[concept map]]

        - When I first saw concept maps, I thought that is where Piggydb’s [knowledge creation process] should lead.

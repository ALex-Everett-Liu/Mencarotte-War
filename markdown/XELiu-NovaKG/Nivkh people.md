- Abstract
    - The **Nivkh**, or **Gilyak** (also **Nivkhs**, or **Gilyaks**; [[ethnonym]]: Нивхгу, __Nʼivxgu__ (Amur) or Ниғвңгун, __Nʼiɣvŋgun__ (E. Sakhalin) "the people"),[4] are an [indigenous ethnic group] inhabiting [the northern half of Sakhalin Island] and the [lower Amur River] and coast on the adjacent Russian mainland and historically possibly parts of [[满洲 (Manchuria)]].
    - Nivkh were traditionally fishermen, hunters, and [dog breeders]. They were semi-nomadic, [living near the coasts] [in the summer] and [wintering inland along streams and rivers] to [catch salmon]([[salmon]]). The land the Nivkh inhabit is characterized as [[taiga]] forest with [cold snow-laden winters] and [[mild summer]]s [with sparse tree cover](((_wkUfVL_c))).[5] The Nivkh are [believed to be] the [original inhabitants of the region](((hTJOeLCmF))), and to derive from [a proposed Neolithic people](((XRmSm_Q8z))) that migrated from the [Transbaikal region] during the [[Late Pleistocene]].[6]

    - The Nivkh had long [maintained trade and cultural relations with] [neighboring China and Japan]. Previously within the Qing China sphere of influence, the Russian Empire [annexed the region] [following two treaties]([[treaty]]) in 1858 and 1860. Subsequently, [traditional Nivkh lifestyle] [was significantly altered by] subsequent [colonization](((sONh6z-oB))) and [[collectivization]].[7][8] Today, the Nivkh live in [Russian-style housing] and with the [overfishing and pollution of the streams and seas]([[overfishing]]), 过度捕捞 they have [adopted many foods from] [Russian cuisine]. The Nivkh practice [[shamanism]], which is important for the winter [[Bear Festival]], though some have converted to [Russian Orthodoxy](((npXpwK5H-))).[9]
    - As of the [2002 Russian Federation census], 5,287 Nivkh exist. Most [speak Russian] today, and [about 10 percent] speak their [native Nivkh language]. Nivkh is [considered a language isolate], although it is grouped, for convenience, with the [[Paleosiberian languages]]. The Nivkh language is [divided into four dialects](((vIU0b8i3g))).[10]

- Etymology
    - __Nivkh__ (plural __Nivkhgu__ in the Nivkh language), an [[endonym]], means "person" in the [Nivkh language]. They may also be referred to as Nivkhi in 1920s [Western literature], due to the romanization of the Russian term plural "нивхи" from "нивх" (nivkh). In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, [Russian explorers] first termed the group Gilyak (also Giliaks or Giliatski). The etymology of the name "Gilyak" is disputed by linguists, with some believing the name originated from an [[exonym]] given to the Nivkhs by a nearby [Tungusic group]. [Other scholars believe that] "Gilyak" derives from Kile, [another nearby Tungusic group] that the Russians had [mistakenly named] Nivkhs.[5] "Gilyak" is the [Russian rendering] of terms derived from the Tungusic "Gileke" and [Manchu-Chinese] "[[Gilemi (吉里迷)]]" (Gilimi, Gilyami) for [culturally similar peoples] of the [Amur River region], and was [applied principally to] the Nivkh [in Western literature].[11]
- Origins
    - The origins of the Nivkh are hard to discern from current archaeological research. Their subsistence by fishing and coastal sea-mammal hunting is very similar to the Koryak and Itelmen on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The rigging of dog-sledges is also similar to these Chukotko-Kamchatkan groups. Spiritual beliefs are similar to those of the Northwest Coast Indians of North America, whose ancestors migrated from this area.[9] The Nivkh are physically and genetically different from the surrounding peoples, and scholars believe they are the indigenous inhabitants of the area. The current archaeological model suggests that a sub-Arctic technological culture originating from the Transbaikal region, termed the microlithic culture, migrated across Siberia and populated the Amur and Sakhalin region during the Late Pleistocene, perhaps earlier.[6] Scientists believe that people of this microlithic (small tool) culture were the first to migrate eastward into the Americas.[12]
    - The microlithic culture was technologically adept in the harsh climate of Siberia during the last ice age. After the ice receded, Tungusic peoples from the south pressed into the warmer northern areas, soon dominating the settled peoples. The Nivkh are considered the last surviving ethnic group able to adapt to the warmer climate and not be assimilated or squeezed out by the newcomers, hence the Nivkh isolate language.[13] The earliest archeological radiocarbon dating for Northern Sakhalin as of 2004 is the Neolithic Age __Imchin Site 2__, dated to 4950–4570 BCE near the Tym' River Estuary on the west coast.[14]
    - Michael Fortescue suggests that Nivkh might be related to the Mosan languages of North America (however, Mosan is generally considered a Sprachbund rather than a language family).[15] Fortescue also presents evidence that Nivkh is related to the Chukotko-Kamchatkans, forming a Chukotko-Kamchatkan–Amuric family,[16] though the evidence was judged to be "insufficient" by Glottolog.[17]


    - More recently, Sergei Nikolaev argued in two papers for a systematic relationship between Nivkh and the Algic languages of North America and a more distant relationship between these two together and the Wakashan languages of coastal British Columbia.[18][19]

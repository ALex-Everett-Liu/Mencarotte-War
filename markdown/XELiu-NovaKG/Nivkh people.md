- The **Nivkh**, or **Gilyak** (also **Nivkhs**, or **Gilyaks**; [[ethnonym]]: Нивхгу, __Nʼivxgu__ (Amur) or Ниғвңгун, __Nʼiɣvŋgun__ (E. Sakhalin) "the people"),[4] are an [indigenous ethnic group] inhabiting [the northern half of Sakhalin Island] and the [lower Amur River] and coast on the adjacent Russian mainland and historically possibly parts of [[满洲 (Manchuria)]].
- Nivkh were traditionally fishermen, hunters, and [dog breeders]. They were semi-nomadic, [living near the coasts] [in the summer] and [wintering inland along streams and rivers] to [catch salmon]([[salmon]]). The land the Nivkh inhabit is characterized as [[taiga]] forest with [cold snow-laden winters] and [[mild summer]]s [with sparse tree cover](((_wkUfVL_c))).[5] The Nivkh are [believed to be] the [original inhabitants of the region](((hTJOeLCmF))), and to derive from [a proposed Neolithic people](((XRmSm_Q8z))) that migrated from the [Transbaikal region] during the [[Late Pleistocene]].[6]

- The Nivkh had long maintained trade and cultural relations with neighboring China and Japan. Previously within the Qing China sphere of influence, the Russian Empire annexed the region following two treaties in 1858 and 1860. Subsequently, traditional Nivkh lifestyle was significantly altered by subsequent colonization and collectivization.[7][8] Today, the Nivkh live in Russian-style housing and with the overfishing and pollution of the streams and seas, they have adopted many foods from Russian cuisine. The Nivkh practice shamanism, which is important for the winter Bear Festival, though some have converted to Russian Orthodoxy.[9]
- As of the 2002 Russian Federation census, 5,287 Nivkh exist. Most speak Russian today, and about 10 percent speak their native Nivkh language. Nivkh is considered a language isolate, although it is grouped, for convenience, with the Paleosiberian languages. The Nivkh language is divided into four dialects.[10]

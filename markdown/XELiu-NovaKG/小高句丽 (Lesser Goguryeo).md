- Little Goguryeo or Lesser Goguryeo (699-820) (小高句麗, 소고구려) is a [hypothetical term] for a state proposed by Japanese scholar [Kaizaburo Hino (ja:日野開三郎)]. [The existence of the state] [has been debated among scholars].[1] The name was not [mentioned in historical records], and the leaders were recorded as Governors-General subject to the Tang dynasty.[2][3]
    - [It was allegedly] 提出但尚未证实 established by [the refugees of Goguryeo](((pALJ6ATz6))) after its defeat by the Tang dynasty.[4] The kingdom was supposedly originally called [[高丽 (Goryeo)]], but later historians added "Lesser" for disambiguation from Goguryeo, which was also often called Goryeo. "Goryeo" is also the name of [a later period of Korean history], and the source of the English name [[Korea]].

- After the Korean Silla kingdom and the Chinese Tang dynasty allied to destroy Goguryeo, the Liaodong Peninsula was administered by the Tang. The theory is that Tang lost effective control due to rebellion by Goguryeo refugees, and the region became a buffer zone between Tang and the Korean kingdom of Balhae. Although Lesser Goguryeo declared itself an independent kingdom, it was soon absorbed into Balhae, which became a successor state to Goguryeo.

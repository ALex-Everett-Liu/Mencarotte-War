- A regulated power supply is an [[embedded circuit]]; it converts [unregulated AC] ([[alternating current (AC)]]) into a [constant DC]. With the help of a [[rectifier]] it [converts AC supply into DC]. Its function is to [supply a stable voltage] (or less often current), to a circuit or device that [must be operated within] [certain power supply limits]. The output from the regulated power supply [may be alternating or unidirectional], but is [nearly always DC] ([[direct current (DC)]]).[1] [The type of stabilization used] [may be restricted to ensuring that] [the output remains within certain limits] [under various load conditions]([[load condition]]), or it may also [include compensation for variations] 变化的补偿 [in its own supply source]. The latter is [much more common] today.

        - A [[bench power supply]] usually refers to [a power supply capable of] [supplying a variety of] [[output voltage]]s useful for BE ([[bench testing]]) electronic circuits, possibly with [continuous variation] of the output voltage, or just some [[preset voltage]]s. Some [have multiple selectable ranges of] [current/voltage limits] which [tend to be anti-proportional].[2][3][4]

        - A [laboratory ("lab") power supply] normally implies [an accurate bench power supply], while a [balanced or tracking power supply] refers to [twin supplies for use] when a circuit [requires both positive and negative] [[supply rail]]s).

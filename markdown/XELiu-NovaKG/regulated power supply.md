- A regulated power supply is an [[embedded circuit]]; it converts [unregulated AC] ([[alternating current (AC)]]) into a [constant DC]. With the help of a [[rectifier]] it [converts AC supply into DC]. Its function is to [supply a stable voltage] (or less often current), to a circuit or device that [must be operated within] [certain power supply limits]. The output from the regulated power supply [may be alternating or unidirectional], but is [nearly always DC] ([[direct current (DC)]]).[1] [The type of stabilization used] [may be restricted to ensuring that] [the output remains within certain limits] [under various load conditions]([[load condition]]), or it may also include compensation for variations in its own supply source. The latter is much more common today.

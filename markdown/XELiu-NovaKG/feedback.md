- Feedback occurs when [outputs of a system]([[system output]]) are [routed back as inputs] as part of [a chain of cause-and-effect]([[cause-and-effect chain]]) that forms a [[circuit]] or [[loop]].[1] The system [can then be said to] [feed back into itself]. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be [handled carefully] when applied to [[feedback system]]s:

    - Simple [[causal reasoning]] about a feedback system is difficult because [the first system influences the second] and second system influences the first, leading to a [[circular argument]]. This makes [reasoning based upon cause and effect] tricky, and [it is necessary to] [analyze the system as a whole](((2ERIl2IZu))).

    - [A feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:General_Feedback_Loop.svg) where [all outputs of a process] are available as [causal inputs](((4gT3P9V1Z))) to that process
- History
    - [[self-regulating mechanism]]s [have existed since] [[antiquity]], and [the idea of feedback] [had started to enter] [[economic theory]] in Britain [by the 18th century], but [it was not at that time] recognized as a [[universal abstraction]] and so [did not have a name].[3]
        - [The first ever known] artificial [[feedback device]] was a [[float valve]], for maintaining water [at a constant level], invented in 270 BC in [[Alexandria]], Egypt.[4] This device [illustrated the principle of feedback]: a [low water level] [opens the valve], [the rising water] then [provides feedback into the system], [closing the valve] [when the required level is reached]. This then [reoccurs in a circular fashion] [as the water level fluctuates].[4] #[[water level]]

    - [Centrifugal governors] were used to [regulate the distance and pressure] between [millstones in windmills]([[windmill]]) [since the 17th century]. In 1788, [[James Watt]] designed his first [[centrifugal governor]] [following a suggestion from] his [[business partner]] Matthew Boulton, for use in the [[steam engine]]s of their production. [Early steam engines] employed a purely [[reciprocating motion]], 采用纯往复运动 and were used for [[pumping water]] – an application that could [tolerate variations in the working speed], 容许工作速度的变化 but [the use of steam engines] [for other applications] [called for more precise control of the speed]([[speed control]]). #millstone

        - In 1868, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] [wrote a famous paper], "On governors", that is [widely considered] a classic in [feedback control theory](((4zSdF8eLA))).[5] This was [a landmark paper on] [[control theory]] and [the mathematics of feedback](((sy9FdFatr))).
- Types
    - Positive and negative feedback
        - Main articles: Negative feedback and Positive feedback
        - Positive feedback: If [the signal feedback from output](((p49eJTP10))) is [[in phase]] with the [[input signal]], the feedback is called [[positive feedback]].
        - Negative feedback: If [the signal feedback] is of [[opposite polarity]] or [[out of phase]] by 180° [with respect to input signal], the feedback is called as [[negative feedback]].

            - [As an example of] negative feedback, the [[diagram]] might represent a [[cruise control]] system in a car, for example, that matches a [[target speed]] such as the [[speed limit]]. The [controlled system] is the car; its input includes the [[combined torque]] from the engine 来自发动机的组合扭矩 and from [the changing slope of the road]([[road slope]]) (the [[disturbance]]). The car's speed ([[status]]) is measured by a [[speedometer]]. 
                - The [[error signal]] is [the departure of the speed] as [measured by the speedometer] from the target speed ([[set point]]). [This measured error] is interpreted by the [[controller]] to [adjust the accelerator], commanding the fuel [flow to the engine] 指令燃油流向发动机 (the [[effector]]). The [resulting change] in [engine torque], the feedback, combines with [the torque exerted by](((0lMFkh8z7))) the [changing road grade](((lIYxvnhKO))) 与不断变化的道路坡度施加的扭矩相结合 to [reduce the error in speed], minimizing the [road disturbance].

- [[feedback loop]]
- ---
- Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of [a chain of cause-and-effect]([[cause-and-effect chain]]) that forms a [[circuit]] or [[loop]].[1] The system can then be said to feed back into itself. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems:
    - Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because the first system influences the second and second system influences the first, leading to a circular argument. This makes reasoning based upon cause and effect tricky, and it is necessary to analyze the system as a whole.

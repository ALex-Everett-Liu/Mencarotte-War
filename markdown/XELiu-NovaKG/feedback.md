- Feedback occurs when [outputs of a system]([[system output]]) are [routed back as inputs] as part of [a chain of cause-and-effect]([[cause-and-effect chain]]) that forms a [[circuit]] or [[loop]].[1] The system [can then be said to] [feed back into itself]. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be [handled carefully] when applied to [[feedback system]]s:

    - Simple [[causal reasoning]] about a feedback system is difficult because [the first system influences the second] and second system influences the first, leading to a [[circular argument]]. This makes [reasoning based upon cause and effect] tricky, and [it is necessary to] [analyze the system as a whole](((2ERIl2IZu))).

- History
    - [[self-regulating mechanism]]s [have existed since] [[antiquity]], and [the idea of feedback] [had started to enter] [[economic theory]] in Britain [by the 18th century], but [it was not at that time] recognized as a [[universal abstraction]] and so [did not have a name].[3]
    - The first ever known artificial feedback device was a float valve, for maintaining water at a constant level, invented in 270 BC in Alexandria, Egypt.[4] This device illustrated the principle of feedback: a low water level opens the valve, the rising water then provides feedback into the system, closing the valve when the required level is reached. This then reoccurs in a circular fashion as the water level fluctuates.[4]


    - Centrifugal governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the 17th century. In 1788, James Watt designed his first centrifugal governor following a suggestion from his business partner Matthew Boulton, for use in the steam engines of their production. Early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion, and were used for pumping water – an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed, but the use of steam engines for other applications called for more precise control of the speed.


    - In 1868, James Clerk Maxwell wrote a famous paper, "On governors", that is widely considered a classic in feedback control theory.[5] This was a landmark paper on control theory and the mathematics of feedback.

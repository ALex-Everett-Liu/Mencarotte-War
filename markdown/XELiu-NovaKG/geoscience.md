- [Earth science]([[earth science]]) or geoscience includes all fields of [[natural science]] related to the planet [[Earth]]. This is [a branch of science] dealing with the physical and [[chemical constitution]] of the Earth and its [[atmosphere]]. Earth science can be considered to be a branch of [[planetary science]], but with a much [older history]. Earth science encompasses four [main branches]([[branch]]) of [[study]], the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the atmosphere, and the [[biosphere]], each of which is further [broken down into] more [specialized fields].

    - There are both [[reductionist]] and [[holistic approach]]es to Earth sciences. It is also the study of Earth and [its neighbors in space]. Some [Earth scientists] use their knowledge of the planet to [locate and develop] [[energy resource]] and [[mineral resource]]s. Others study the impact of [[human activity]] on [Earth's environment](), and [design methods to] [protect the planet]. Some use their knowledge about [[earth process]]es such as [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s, and [[hurricane]]s to [plan communities] 规划社区 that will not [expose people to] these [dangerous events].

    - The Earth sciences can include the study of [[geology]], the lithosphere, and the [[large-scale structure]] of the [Earth's interior], as well as the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Typically, Earth scientists use tools from geology, [[chronology]], physics, chemistry, [[geography]], biology, and mathematics to [build a quantitative understanding]([[quantitative]]) of how the Earth [works and evolves].

    - Earth science affects our [everyday lives]([[everyday life]]). For example, [meteorologist]([[meteorology]])s study the [[weather]] and [watch for dangerous storms]([[storm]]). [Hydrologist]([[hydrology]])s study [[water]] and [warn of floods]([[flood]]). [Seismologist]([[seismology]])s study earthquakes and try to understand [where they will strike]. Geologists study [[rock]]s and help to [locate useful minerals]([[mineral]]).

        - Earth scientists often work in the [[field]]—perhaps [[climbing mountains]], exploring the [[seabed]], crawling through [[cave]]s, 在洞穴中爬行 or wading in [[swamp]]s. 在沼泽中涉水 They measure and [collect samples]() (such as rocks or [river water]), then they [record their findings] on [[chart]]s and [[map]]s.

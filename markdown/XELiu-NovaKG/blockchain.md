- A blockchain is [a growing list of records], called blocks, that are linked using [[cryptography]].[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a [[cryptographic hash]] of the previous block,[4] a [[timestamp]], and [[transaction data]] (generally represented as a [[Merkle tree]]). By design, a blockchain is resistant to [modification of its data](((mqHCXxphE))). This is because [once recorded](((jftJYUko-))), [the data in any given block] cannot be [altered retroactively](((3xUwlrviq))) 追溯性改变 without [alteration of all subsequent blocks].

    - For use as a [[distributed ledger]], a blockchain is typically managed by a [[peer-to-peer network]] collectively adhering to a protocol for [[inter-node communication]] and [validating new blocks](((7vTyTc_te))). Although [blockchain records] are not [unalterable](((WW09DE9zv))), blockchains [may be considered secure by design] and exemplify a [[distributed computing system]] with high [[Byzantine fault tolerance]]. The blockchain [has been described as] "an open, distributed ledger that can [record transactions between two parties](((BH8oN2bZF))) efficiently and in a [verifiable](((WjxKEuSQe))) and permanent way".[5]

- The blockchain was invented by a person (or [group of people]) using the name [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008 to serve as the [[public transaction ledger]] of the [[cryptocurrency]] [[bitcoin (BTC)]].[3] The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto [remains unknown to date]. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first [[digital currency]] to [solve the double-spending problem]([[double-spending problem]]) [without the need of] a [[trusted authority]] or [[central server]]. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail.[6] Private blockchains have been proposed for business use but Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil".[7] However, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore secure in practice than permissionless ones.[4][8]

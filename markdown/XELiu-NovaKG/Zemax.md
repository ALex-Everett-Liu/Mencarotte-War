- Zemax is a company that sells [[optical design software]].[1] OpticStudio is its [[flagship product]] and a [commonly used] [optical design program] for Microsoft Windows.[2](((UzGrB52Ja)))[3][4][5] It is used for the [design and analysis] of both [[imaging system]] and [[illumination system]]s.
- Features and applications
    - OpticStudio is an optical design program that is used to [design and analyze] imaging systems such as [[camera lens]]es, as well as illumination systems. It works by [[ray tracing]]—modelling [the propagation of rays] through an [[optical system]]. It can model the effect of [[optical element]]s such as [[simple lens]]es, [[aspheric lens]]es, [[gradient-index lens]]es, mirrors, and [[diffractive optical element (DOE)]]s, and can produce [standard analysis diagrams] such as [[spot diagram]]s and [[ray-fan plot]]s.[10][13] 射线扇形图 OpticStudio can also [model the effect of] [[optical coating]]s [on the surfaces of components].[10] It includes a library of stock commercial lenses.[14] 库存 
        - OpticStudio can perform [standard sequential ray tracing] through optical elements, [[non-sequential ray tracing]] for analysis of [[stray light]], 杂散光 and [[physical optics]] [[beam propagation]]. It also has [[tolerancing capability]], to allow [analysis of the effect of] [[manufacturing defect]]s and [[assembly error]]s.[15] 装配错误

        - The [physical optics propagation feature] [can be used for problems] where diffraction is important, including the [[propagation of laser beams]] and [the coupling of light into]([[coupling of light into optical fibers]]) [[single-mode optical fiber]]s.[16](((Z1aQxdsna))) OpticStudio's [[optimization tool]]s [can be used to improve] [an initial lens design] by [automatically adjusting parameters] to [[maximize performance]] and [[reduce aberrations]].[17]

            - [Ray tracing method] is used to calculate the [spot pattern] for different [lens section plane], 剖面成像系统焦面 and then lens section plane of available [dielectric material] is optimized to reduce aberrations, 减小像差 so as to [expand the field-of view]. dict.[cnki].net
            - In addition, the [light point] and [test point] are proposed to be placed at [paraxial conjugate positions] 近轴共轭点 [properly selected] to [reduce system aberrations] in the test. www.[fabiao].net

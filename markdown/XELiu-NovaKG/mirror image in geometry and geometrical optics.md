    - __Main article: __[[reflectional symmetry]]
- ## In three dimensions
    - The concept of reflection [can be extended to] [[three-dimensional object]]s, including the [inside parts], even if they are not [[transparent]]. The term then relates to [structural aspects] as well as [visual aspects]. A three-dimensional object is reversed [in the direction perpendicular to] the mirror surface. In physics, mirror images are [investigated in the subject] called [[geometrical optics]].

    - In chemistry, two versions ([[isomer]]s) of a [[molecule]], one a "mirror image" of the other, are called [[enantiomer]]s if they are not "[[superposable]]" 可叠合, 置于上面 (the correct [[technical term]], though the term "superimposable" is also used) on each other. That is an example of [chirality (chemistry)]([[chirality]]). In general, [an object and its mirror image] are called enantiomorphs. 对映异构体
    - If [a point of an object] has [[coordinate]]s (__x__, __y__, __z__) then the image of this point (as reflected by a mirror in the __y__, __z__ [[plane]]) has coordinates (-__x__, __y__, __z__). Thus reflection is [a reversal of] the [[coordinate axis]] [[perpendicular]] ([[normal]]) to [the mirror's surface]. Although a plane mirror [reverses an object] [only in the direction] [normal to the mirror surface], there is usually [a perception of] a [[left-right reversal]]. Hence, the reversal is called "[[lateral inversion]]". 横向倒置/反演/反转 
        - The perception of a left-right reversal is probably because [the left and right of an object] are defined by its [perceived top and front], but [there is still some debate about]([[debate]]) the explanation amongst [[psychologist]]s. [The psychology of] the perceived left-right reversal is discussed in "Much ado about mirrors" by [Professor Michael Corballis] (see "external links", below).
    - A mirror image [appears more obviously three-dimensional] [if the observer moves], or if the image is viewed using [[binocular vision]]. This is because the [[relative position]] of objects changes as the observer's [[perspective]] changes, or is [differently viewed with each eye].[1](((PvT0NQ9Wa)))

    - ### Effect of mirror on [[the lighting of the scene]]
        - A mirror does not just [produce an image] of what would be there without it; it also changes the [[light distribution]] [in the halfspace] [in front of and behind the mirror]. A mirror [hanging on the wall] [makes the room brighter] because [[additional light source]]s [appear in the mirror image]. 
            - However, [the appearance of additional light] does not violate the [[conservation of energy]] principle, because some light [no longer reaches] [behind the mirror], as the mirror simply re-directs the [[light energy]]. In terms of the light distribution, the [[virtual mirror image]] [has the same appearance] and [the same effect as a real]([[real image]]), ^^[symmetrically arranged] [[half-space]] [behind a window] (instead of the mirror).^^ [[shadow]]s may [extend from the mirror into] [the halfspace before it], and vice versa.

- Patterns in nature are [visible regularities](((jCBLIut7Q))) of form found in the [[natural world]]. These patterns [recur in different contexts] 不同语境下再现/反复出现 and can sometimes be [modelled mathematically]([[mathematical modeling]]). Natural patterns include [symmetries]([[symmetry]]), trees, [[spiral]]s, meanders, waves, [[foam]]s, tessellations, [[crack]]s and [[stripe]]s.[1]

    - Early [[Greek philosopher]]s studied pattern, with [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]] [attempting to explain] [[order]] in nature. The [modern understanding] of [visible patterns] [developed gradually] over time.
    - In the 19th century, the Belgian physicist [Joseph Plateau] examined [[soap film]]s, 肥皂膜 leading him to [formulate the concept of] a [[minimal surface]]. 形成了最小表面的概念 The German biologist and artist [Ernst Haeckel] painted hundreds of [[marine organism]]s to [emphasise their symmetry]. Scottish biologist [D'Arcy Thompson] [pioneered the study of] [[growth pattern]]s in both [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, showing that [simple equations] could explain [[spiral growth]]. 
        - [D'Arcy Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Drcy.svg) [pioneered the study of] [growth and form] in his 1917 book.
    - In the 20th century, the British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] predicted mechanisms of [[morphogenesis]] which [give rise to] patterns of [[spot]]s and stripes. The Hungarian biologist [Aristid Lindenmayer] and the [French American] mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] showed how the mathematics of [[fractal]]s could create [plant growth patterns].

    - Mathematics, physics and chemistry can explain patterns in nature at [[different level]]s. Patterns in [[living things]] are explained by the [[biological process]]es of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]]. Studies of [pattern formation] make use of [[computer model]]s to [simulate a wide range of patterns].

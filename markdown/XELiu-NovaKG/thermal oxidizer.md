- A thermal oxidizer (also known as thermal oxidiser, or [thermal incinerator]) is a [[process unit]] for [[air pollution control]] in many [[chemical plant]]s that [decomposes hazardous gases](((TRVYfWYKX))) at a [[high temperature]] and [releases them into the atmosphere](((XY-kTdGTq))).

        - Main article: regenerative thermal oxidizer
        - One of today's [most widely accepted] [air pollution control technologies] [across industry] is a regenerative thermal oxidizer, [commonly referred to as] a RTO. RTOs use a [[ceramic bed]] which is heated from a previous [[oxidation cycle]] to [[preheat]] the [[input gas]]es to [partially oxidize them]([[oxidize]]). The preheated gases enter a combustion chamber that is heated by an external fuel source to reach the target oxidation temperature which is in the range between 760 °C (1,400 °F) and 820 °C (1,510 °F). The final temperature may be as high as 1,100 °C (2,010 °F) for applications that require maximum destruction. The air flow rates are 2.4 to 240 standard cubic meters per second.[4]

        - RTOs are very versatile and extremely efficient – thermal efficiency can reach 95%. They are regularly used for abating solvent fumes, odours, etc. from a wide range of industries. Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers are ideal in a range of low to high VOC concentrations up to 10 g/m3 solvent. There are currently many types of Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers on the market with the capability of 99.5+% Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) oxidization or destruction efficiency. The ceramic heat exchanger(s) in the towers can be designed for thermal efficiencies as high as 97+%.

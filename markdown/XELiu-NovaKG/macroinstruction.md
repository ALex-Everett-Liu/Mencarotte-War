- A macro (short for "macroinstruction", from Greek combining form μακρο- 'long, large'[1]) in computer science is a rule or pattern that specifies how a [certain input] should be [mapped to a replacement output]([[map to a replacement output]]). Applying a macro to an input is [[macro expansion]]. [The input and output may be] a sequence of [[lexical token]]s 词汇符号 or characters, or a [[syntax tree]].

    - [[character macro]]s are supported in software applications to make it easy to [[invoke]] common [[command sequence]]s. [Token and tree macros] are supported in some programming languages to enable [[code reuse]] or to [[extend the language]], sometimes for [[domain-specific language]]s.
    - Macros are used to make a sequence of [[computing instruction]]s available to the programmer as a [[single program statement]], making the [[programming task]] less tedious 冗长, 乏味 and less [[error-prone]].[2][3] 容易出错 (Thus, they are called "macros" because a "big" block of code can be expanded from [a "small" sequence of characters]([[character sequence]]).) 
    - Macros often allow [[positional parameter]] or [[keyword parameter]]s that dictate what the [[conditional assembler program]] generates 汇编 and have been used to create entire programs or program suites according to such variables as [[operating system (OS)]], platform or other factors. The term derives from "macro instruction", and such expansions were originally used in generating [[assembly language]] code.

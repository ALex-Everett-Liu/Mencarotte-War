- The [entropy of entanglement] (or entanglement entropy) is a [[measure]] of [the degree of quantum entanglement between] two [[subsystem]]s [constituting a two-part composite quantum system]. Given a [[pure bipartite quantum state]] of the [composite system], [it is possible to obtain] a [[reduced density matrix]] [describing knowledge of the state] of a subsystem. The entropy of entanglement is the [[Von Neumann entropy]] of the reduced density matrix [for any of the subsystems]. If it is non-zero, i.e. the subsystem is in a [[mixed state]], it indicates [the two subsystems are entangled].

    - More mathematically; if a state [describing two subsystems] A and B $${\displaystyle |\Psi _{AB}\rangle =|\phi _{A}\rangle |\phi _{B}\rangle }$$ is a [[separable state]], then the reduced density matrix $${\displaystyle \rho _{A}=\operatorname {Tr} _{B}|\Psi _{AB}\rangle \langle \Psi _{AB}|=|\phi _{A}\rangle \langle \phi _{A}|}$$ is a [[pure state]]. Thus, the entropy of the state is zero. Similarly, the density matrix of B would also have 0 entropy. A reduced density matrix having a non-zero entropy is therefore a signal of the existence of entanglement in the system.

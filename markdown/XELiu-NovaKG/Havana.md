- Hey
 
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
All of my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na
 
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
(When he came in the room)
He said there’s a lot of girls I can do with
(But I can't without you)
I'm doin' forever in a minute
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him (evil)
He got me feelin' like
 
Oooh-oooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Oooh-oooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na
 
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)
All of my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana
Havana, ooh na-na

Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn
Fresh out East Atlanta
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam (jam) / 在她的车后保险杠上迎面一撞

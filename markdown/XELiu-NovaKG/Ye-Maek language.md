    - The [Yemaek people] [had historical ties to] [later Korean kingdoms] and may have been ancestral to several, such as Gojoseon; the Ye of Yemaek are reported to have been a synonym for Buyeo and the Maek for Goguryeo. Their language may have been one of, or ancestral to, the Koguryoic languages.
    - [Evidence for the language] is [limited to toponyms]([[toponym]]), and its existence is questionable. Attempts at recovering Yemaek words from toponyms in the [[三國史記 (Samguk Sagi)]] historical record are disputed.[1]

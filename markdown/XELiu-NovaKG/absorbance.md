- Absorbance is commonly defined[1] as "the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of incident to transmitted [[radiant power]] through a [[sample]] (excluding the effects on [[cell wall]]s)". Alternatively, for samples which scatter light, absorbance may be defined as "the [negative logarithm] of one minus [[absorptance]], as measured on a [[uniform sample]]".[2] The term is used in many [technical areas] to [quantify the results of] an [experimental measurement].  
    - While the term has its origin in [quantifying the absorption of light]([[light absorption]]), [it is often entangled with] [quantification of light which is “lost” to] a [[detector]] system [through other mechanisms].  What [these uses of the term] [tend to have in common] is that they refer to a logarithm of the ratio of a quantity of light incident on a sample or material to that which is detected after the light has [interacted with the sample].

    - The term [[absorption]] refers to the [[physical process]] of [absorbing light], while absorbance does not always [measure only absorption]: it may measure [[attenuation]] (of [transmitted radiant power](((h7pB6Gh8b)))), caused by absorption, but also reflection, scattering, and other physical processes.

- ## History and uses of the term absorbance
    - ### Bouguer-Lambert law
        - The roots of the term absorbance are in the law of Bouguer ([[Bouguer-Lambert law]]).  As light [moves through a media](((qfU6t6GvB))), [it will become dimmer] [as it is being "extinguished"].  Bouguer recognized that this [[extinction]] (now often called [[attenuation]]) [was not linear with distance] [traveled through the medium], but related by what we now refer to as an [exponential function].  
        - If {\displaystyle I_{0}}I_{0} is [the intensity of the light]([[light intensity]]) [at the beginning of the travel] and {\displaystyle I_{s}}I_s is the intensity of the light detected [after travel of a distance] d, the fraction transmitted, T, is given by:  $${\displaystyle T={\frac {I_{s}}{I_{0}}}=exp(-\mu d)}$$, where \mu  is called an [[attenuation constant]] (a term [used in various fields] where a signal is transmitted though a medium) or coefficient.  [The amount of light transmitted] is [falling off exponentially with distance].  Taking the Napierian (natural) logarithm in the above equation, we get:  {\displaystyle -ln(T)=ln{\frac {I_{0}}{I_{s}}}=\mu d}{\displaystyle -ln(T)=ln{\frac {I_{0}}{I_{s}}}=\mu d} . For scattering media, the constant is often divided into two parts, {\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{s}+\mu _{a}}{\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{s}+\mu _{a}} , separating it into a scattering coefficient, {\displaystyle \mu _{s}}{\displaystyle \mu _{s}}, and an absorption coefficient, {\displaystyle \mu _{a}}\mu_a,[3] obtaining:{\displaystyle -ln(T)=ln{\frac {I_{0}}{I_{s}}}=(\mu _{s}+\mu _{a})d}{\displaystyle -ln(T)=ln{\frac {I_{0}}{I_{s}}}=(\mu _{s}+\mu _{a})d} .

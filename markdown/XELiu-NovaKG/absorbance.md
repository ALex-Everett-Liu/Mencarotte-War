- Absorbance is commonly defined[1] as "the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of incident to transmitted [[radiant power]] through a [[sample]] (excluding the effects on [[cell wall]]s)". Alternatively, for samples which scatter light, absorbance may be defined as "the [negative logarithm] of one minus [[absorptance]], as measured on a [[uniform sample]]".[2] The term is used in many [technical areas] to [quantify the results of] an [experimental measurement].  
    - While the term has its origin in [quantifying the absorption of light]([[light absorption]]), [it is often entangled with] [quantification of light which is “lost” to] a [[detector]] system [through other mechanisms].  What [these uses of the term] [tend to have in common] is that they refer to a logarithm of the ratio of a quantity of light incident on a sample or material to that which is detected after the light has [interacted with the sample].

    - The term [[absorption]] refers to the [[physical process]] of [absorbing light], while absorbance does not always [measure only absorption]: it may measure [[attenuation]] (of [transmitted radiant power](((h7pB6Gh8b)))), caused by absorption, but also reflection, scattering, and other physical processes.

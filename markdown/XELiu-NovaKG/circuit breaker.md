- A circuit breaker is an [electrical safety device] designed to protect an [[electrical circuit]] from [damage caused by] an [[overcurrent]] or [[short circuit]]. [Its basic function is to] [interrupt current flow] to [protect equipment] and to [prevent the risk of fire]. Unlike a [[fuse]], 保险丝/熔断丝 which [operates once] and [then must be replaced], a circuit breaker [can be reset] (either manually or automatically) to [resume normal operation].

    - Circuit breakers are [made in varying sizes], from [small devices] that [protect low-current circuits] or individual [[household appliance]]s, to large [[switchgear]] 开关柜/开关齿轮 designed to [protect high voltage circuits]([[high voltage]]) [feeding an entire city]. The generic function of a circuit breaker, or fuse, as [an automatic means of] [removing power from] [a faulty system], is often abbreviated as [[OCPD (Over Current Protection Device)]].

- Operation
    - All circuit breaker systems [have common features in] their operation, but [details vary substantially] depending on the [[voltage class]], [[current rating]] and type of the circuit breaker.
    - The circuit breaker must first [detect a fault condition]. In small [[mains]] and [[low voltage]] circuit breakers, this is usually [done within the device itself]. Typically, the [heating or magnetic effects] of [[electric current]] are employed. Circuit breakers for [large currents] or [high voltages] are [usually arranged with] [protective relay pilot devices]([[protective relay]]) to [sense a fault condition] and to [operate the opening mechanism]. These typically require a separate power source, such as a battery, although some high-voltage circuit breakers are self-contained with current transformers, protective relays, and an internal control power source.
    - Once a fault is detected, the circuit breaker contacts must open to interrupt the circuit; this is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a manual control lever to switch off the load or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use solenoids to trip the mechanism, and electric motors to restore energy to the springs.

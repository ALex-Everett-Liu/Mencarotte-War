- A vacuum tube, [[electron tube]],[1][2][3] valve (British usage), or tube (North America),[4] is a device that controls electric current [flow in a high vacuum] between [[electrode]]s to which an [[electric potential difference]] has been applied.

    - The type known as a thermionic tube or thermionic valve utilizes thermionic emission of electrons from a [[hot cathode]] for [fundamental electronic functions] such as [[signal amplification]] and [[current rectification]]. Non-thermionic types such as a vacuum phototube, however, achieve electron emission through the photoelectric effect, and are used for such purposes as the detection of light intensities. In both types, the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the anode by the electric field in the tube.

- A flange is a [protruded ridge], lip or rim, 凸出的脊、唇或边缘 either external or internal, that serves to [increase strength] (as the flange of an [[iron beam]] 铁梁 such as an I-beam or a T-beam); 工字梁或T形梁 [for easy attachment/transfer of] [[contact force]] [with another object] (as the flange [on the end of a pipe]([[pipe]]), [[steam cylinder]], etc., or on the [[lens mount]] of a camera); or for [stabilizing and guiding the movements of a machine] or its parts (as the [inside flange] of a [rail car] or [tram wheel], 有轨电车车轮 which keep the wheels from [running off the rails]). The term "flange" is also used for [a kind of tool used to] [form flanges].

- Plumbing or piping
    - A flange can also be **[a plate or ring] to [form a rim] [at the end of a pipe] when [fastened to the pipe]** 系紧, 固定 (for example, a closet flange). A [[blind flange]] is a plate for [covering or closing the end of a pipe]. A [flange joint] is [a connection of pipes], where the [connecting pieces] have flanges [by which the parts are bolted together](((2YLA2J_Gf))).

    - Although the word 'flange' generally refers to [the actual raised rim or lip of a fitting], many [flanged plumbing fittings](((n_UGdi50V))) are themselves known as flanges.
- ## Pipe flanges
    - [Piping components] [can be bolted together between flanges](((2YLA2J_Gf))). 用螺栓连接在法兰之间 Flanges are used to [connect pipes with each other], to valves, to fittings, and to [specialty items] such as [[strainer]]s and [[pressure vessel]]s. A [[cover plate]] [can be connected to create] a "[[blind flange]]".[1] Flanges are [joined by bolting](((TzuqXfXGt))), and [[sealing]] is often [completed with the use of] [[gasket]]s [or other methods]. [Mechanical means] to [mitigate effects of leaks]([[leak]]), 减轻泄漏的影响 like [spray guards] 喷淋防护罩 or [specific spray flanges], 特定的喷雾法兰 may be included. Industries where flammable, volatile, toxic or [corrosive substances] are being processed [have greater need of] [special protection] at [flanged connections](((nJ3eEeF_K))). [Flange guards](((XK7WRCmLT))) 法兰防护装置/防护罩 can to provide that [added level of protection] to [ensure safety].[2]

    - A flange is a method of connecting pipes, valves, pumps and other equipment to [form a piping system]. It also [provides easy access for] cleaning, inspection or modification. 检查或修改 Flanges are usually [welded]([[weld]]) or [screwed]([[screw]]). [Flanged joints]([[joint]]) are made by [bolting together two flanges](((2YLA2J_Gf))) [with a gasket between them]([[gasket]]) to [provide a seal]([[seal]]).

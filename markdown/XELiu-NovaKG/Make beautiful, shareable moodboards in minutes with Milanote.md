- ## How to make a moodboard in 10 easy steps
    - A [[moodboard]] is [a collection of visual materials](((tVw9MAFma))) that [evoke a certain style or concept]. Designers, illustrators, photographers, filmmakers and all types of [[creative professional]]s create moodboards to [communicate the "feel" of an idea]. They can be [a powerful starting point in] [a creative project]—[a visual reference for] the team and [a springboard for new ideas]. 跳板

        - But moodboards [have come a long way since the days of] [attaching printouts to physical boards]([[board]]) 打印件 or [creating static PDFs]. [Digital moodboards] [have the ability to] include video, bring together a remote team, and [evolve over time]—[unlocking a whole new world of] [creative possibilities].

    - In this guide, you'll learn the [modern approach to] creating a moodboard using Milanote. Remember, the [creative process] is non-linear, so [you may find yourself] [moving back and forth between the steps] as you go.
- ### 1. Set the direction of your project
    - Moodboards can be literal and practical ([featuring fonts](((8PLpv2cqs))), [color schemes](https://www.evinex.com/color-schemes/) and images that you [actually plan to use] [in the final piece of work]) or [they can be more about] [exploring tone and mood]. You can [tackle these two different types sequentially], or just do one at a time. #[[color scheme]]
        - Remember, a moodboard is [all about exploration], so [don't get too attached to] a [particular direction]. It's important to [keep an open mind about](((8LPI4xpdu))) [what the right solution might be].
        - Once you've [found a direction], [give your moodboard a name] and [jot down some initial ideas] 草草记下，匆匆写下 in a [text note] before you [start to collect inspiration](((ldgrFJ-jK))).
    - How to do this in Milanote
        - [Create a new board] for [each moodboard direction].
            - Show me how
        - [Save time with] a moodboard [[template]].
            - Each new board [gives you the options to] [start with a beautiful template].
        - Pro tip:
            - Creativity often [responds well to some constraints or limitations]. Picking a keyword, theme, color or style [can be a great way to] [give some direction to] your moodboard.

- ### 2. Collect existing material
    - Now that you've [established the direction for] your moodboard, add any [written content] you have. This might include [[brand value]]s, [positioning statements](((UDbxm8dDY))), [tag-lines](((vqq6Z0z_D))) or [any other parts of the brief] that [will inspire you] and [keep you on track]. 让你步入正轨

    - Next, add any [[logo]]s, [existing expressions of the brand] like websites, [[design element]]s or photography. These might not [make it into the final moodboard], but they're still [a great place to start].
    - Drag files from your computer.
        - Click the "Upload file" button or just [drag a file onto your board]. You can add images, logos, documents, videos, audio and much more.

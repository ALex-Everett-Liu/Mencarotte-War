- ## How to make a moodboard in 10 easy steps
    - A [[moodboard]] is [a collection of visual materials](((tVw9MAFma))) that [evoke a certain style or concept]. Designers, illustrators, photographers, filmmakers and all types of [[creative professional]]s create moodboards to [communicate the "feel" of an idea]. They can be [a powerful starting point in] [a creative project]—[a visual reference for] the team and [a springboard for new ideas]. 跳板

        - But moodboards [have come a long way since the days of] [attaching printouts to physical boards]([[board]]) 打印件 or [creating static PDFs]. [Digital moodboards] [have the ability to] include video, bring together a remote team, and [evolve over time]—[unlocking a whole new world of] [creative possibilities].

    - In this guide, you'll learn the [modern approach to] creating a moodboard using Milanote. Remember, the [creative process] is non-linear, so [you may find yourself] [moving back and forth between the steps] as you go.
- ### 1. Set the direction of your project
    - Moodboards can be literal and practical (featuring fonts, [color schemes](https://www.evinex.com/color-schemes/) and images that you actually plan to use in the final piece of work) or they can be more about exploring tone and mood. You can tackle these two different types sequentially, or just do one at a time.

- Thread seal tape 螺纹密封带/生料带 (also known as PTFE tape, [[Teflon]] tape, or plumber's tape) 水管工 is a [[polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)]] [film tape] 聚四氟乙烯 薄膜带 commonly used in [[plumbing]] for [sealing pipe threads](((usZqWMIw6))). 管道中 The tape is sold [cut to specific widths] and [wound on a spool], 缠绕在线轴上 [making it easy to] [wind around pipe threads]. Thread seal tape lubricates allowing for [a deeper seating of the threads], 加油润滑 and it helps [prevent the threads from seizing] [when being unscrewed].[1] 拧下时防止螺纹卡住 The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten,[2] and instead making it easier to tighten.[1]

    - Typically the tape is wrapped around a pipe's thread three times before it is screwed into place. It is commonly used commercially in applications including pressurized water systems, central heating systems, and air compression equipment.
    - Temperature Range: -268°C to +260°C (-450°F to +500°F). PTFE is completely stable up to +260˚C (500˚F). Decomposition is slow up to 400°C (750°F). Decomposition will occur on contact with open flames.
    - Thread seal tape is [wrapped around the threads]([[thread]]), [lubricating the connection] 润滑连接头 and allowing the two pieces to be [screwed deeper together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E6%96%BD%E5%B7%A5.jpg).
    - 生料带，也被称为[生胶带]，香港有时音译[士丁胶布]也可称为“贴布西露”，是聚四氟乙烯薄膜，常见白色，但也可是各种颜色。白色聚四氟乙烯是[单密度]，黄色的是双倍，粉红色的则是三倍。

- In probability theory and statistics, the coefficient of variation (CV), also known as relative standard deviation (RSD), is a [[standardized measure]] of [[dispersion]] 离散度的标准化度量 of a [[probability distribution]] or [[frequency distribution]]. It is often expressed as a [[percentage]], and is [defined as the ratio of] the [[standard deviation]] {\displaystyle \ \sigma }\ \sigma  to the [[mean]] {\displaystyle \ \mu }\ \mu  (or its [absolute value], $${\displaystyle |\mu |}$$).

    - The CV or RSD is widely used in [[analytical chemistry]] to express the [[precision]] and [[repeatability]] of an [[assay]]. It is also commonly used in fields such as engineering or physics when doing quality assurance studies and ANOVA gauge R&R.[citation needed] In addition, CV is utilized by economists and investors in economic models.
- Definition
    - The coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation {\displaystyle \ \sigma }\ \sigma  to the mean {\displaystyle \ \mu }\ \mu , $${\displaystyle c_{\rm {v}}={\frac {\sigma }{\mu }}.}$$[1] It shows the extent of [[variability]] in relation to [the mean of the population](((PRYaibuKn))). The coefficient of variation [should be computed only for] data measured on a [[ratio scale]], 按比例测量的数据 that is, scales that have a [[meaningful zero]] and hence allow [[relative comparison]] of two measurements (i.e., division of one measurement by the other). The coefficient of variation [may not have any meaning for] data on an [[interval scale]].[2] 区间尺度上的数据

        - For example, most [[temperature scale]]s (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit etc.) are interval scales with [[arbitrary zero]]s, so the computed coefficient of variation would be different [depending on which scale you used]. On the other hand, [[Kelvin temperature]] has a meaningful zero, the [complete absence] of [[thermal energy]], and thus is a ratio scale. In plain language, [it is meaningful to say that] 20 Kelvin is twice as hot as 10 Kelvin, but only in this scale with a true [[absolute zero]]. While a [[standard deviation (SD)]] can be measured in Kelvin, Celsius, or Fahrenheit, the value computed is [only applicable to that scale]. Only the Kelvin scale can be used to compute a valid coefficient of variability.

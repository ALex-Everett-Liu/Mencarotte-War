- Abstract 
    - Ye or Dongye (Korean [[pronunciation]]: [toŋ.je]), which means the Eastern Ye, was a Korean [[chiefdom]] which [occupied portions of] the [northeastern Korean peninsula] from roughly 3rd-century BC to around early 5th-century. It bordered [[高句丽 (Goguryeo)]] and [[沃沮 (Okjeo)]] to the north, [[辰韓 (Jinhan)]] to the south, and China's [[乐浪郡 (Lelang Commandery)]] to the west. Today, this [[territory]] consists of the provinces of South Hamgyŏng and Kangwon in North Korea, and Gangwon in South Korea.

    - Ye [appears in history] as a [[vassal state]] of Goguryeo. In early 5th-century, however, King Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo [[annex]]ed Ye, leading to Goguryeo's domination of the entire [northern portion] of the Korean peninsula and most of [[满洲 (Manchuria)]]. A small part of Ye in the south was absorbed into [[新罗 (Silla)]].
- People and culture
    - The Ye considered themself as [the same people as] of Goguryeo, and shared the language and [[ethnic origin]]s with the people of Okjeo and Goguryeo. This may indicate that Dongye also shared a [[common origin]] with [[扶余 (Buyeo)]] and [[Gojoseon (古朝鮮)]]. The [[population]] was recorded to be 280,000 [families]([[family]]).
    - Very little information about Ye has survived; most of the [[extant information]] comes from the discussion of the [Eastern barbarians]([[barbarian]]) in the Chinese [[三国志 (Records of Three Kingdoms)]].

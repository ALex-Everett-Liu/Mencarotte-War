- Just as humans are incapable of [[generating random numbers]], we struggle to [consciously generate random ideas] - to the point where [actively trying to] ‘think differently’ often seems to only further calcify [[existing pattern]]s. Instead of [attempting to brute-force creativity]([[creativity]]), 试图蛮力创造力 the brain [must be confronted with] [[novel stimuli]] 面对新的刺激 in order to [reorganize its perception]([[reorganize the perception]]). [Exposure to] [a certain amount of] [random ‘noise’]([[random noise]]) - [[drug]]s, [[dream]]s, [[meditation]], [Tarot readings], [[mistake]]s - **can [jolt thoughts out of] [well-tracked grooves]** 把思想从井然有序的沟壑中解放出来/颠覆思路 and into [entirely new areas] of idea-space. Typically these [[insight]]s [occur at the juncture of]([[juncture]]) two or more seemingly [[unrelated fields]], [[concept]]s, or [[image]]s. #[[brainstorm]]

- The [[interconnectivity]] of the Roam knowledge graph **constantly [creates opportunities for] serendipity to blossom.** [Each node in the network] [can be viewed in] several [[graphical display]]s, [allowing users to] see [[related ideas]], [scan up and down] 上下来回扫描 the [[vertical hierarchy]], examine [nearby clusters of nodes](((zukNbAkDh))), and [observe patterns]([[pattern]]). 观察节点集群的模式/图样

- The Roam [[search function]] [can be calibrated to include](((585ec1IO1))) [as much or as little] ‘noise’ [as the user desires](((Xvs9c7x_C))). While looking for a [specific passage]([[passage]]) or note, search is [narrow enough] to [find exactly] [what the user has in mind]. However, [it can also be broadened out for] ‘fishing trips’ aimed at [surfacing categories of ideas]. 将各类点子披露出来/上升浮出水面 Some [[search result]]s will [consist of notes] that the user might otherwise [have forgotten about], some will be [[noise]], and others will [spark ideas](((gKeRfF3pd))) [the user didn’t even know] [they were looking for]. #[[sw/filter]]

- The [[synthesis]] and [cross-pollination](((m-hEpxP_B))) of ideas [from diverse fields](((_z7h4TgGm))) [presents low-hanging fruit] 低垂 [for both individuals and society]. [The investment of time]([[time investment]]) and [[effort]] required to become a [[specialist]] [quickly runs into a point of] [[diminishing return]]s. By contrast, accumulating a ‘talent stack’ of [dilettante-level knowledge or skills]([[dilettante-level skill]]) can [unlock insights and opportunities] that [have not been capitalised on by](((kxGzk64EW))) [[expert]]s with a [narrower focus]([[focus]]).

    - Highly [[specialised knowledge]] [remains essential for] [opening new frontiers]. However, an [[interdisciplinary approach]] [is often required to] solve the increasingly [[complex problem]]s faced by [[scientist]]s, [[technologist]]s, and [[policymaker]]s.

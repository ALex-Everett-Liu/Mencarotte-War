- Sushen is the modern Chinese name for [an ancient ethnic group of people](((nWSg6QJyg))) who [lived in the northeastern part of China] (in the area of modern Jilin and Heilongjiang) and what is [in modern times] the [Russian Maritime Province] and some other [Siberian provinces].

    - According to the [[国语 (Guoyu)]] and the [[山海经 (Classic of Mountains and Seas)]] published [in the Warring States period] (476–221 BCE), Sushen was [the name of the tribe] who lived in Shandong and border of Liaoxi Province.[2](((c-mTEe6ME)))
    - The name's characters appeared as early as the 6th century BC [in Chinese documents]. They are [almost unknown with the exception of the fact that] they [lived to the north of China] and used [flint-headed wooden arrows], 燧石 farmed, hunted, and fished, and [lived in caves and trees].[3](((wS8Bug1oP))) Ancient Chinese believed that the Sushen [paid arrows as tribute to]([[tribute]]) [an ideal Chinese ruler]. In other words, [an arrival of Sushen delegates] was, 代表团 for the Chinese, [an auspicious sign of](((rrzrKXHet))) [the Chinese ruler's virtue].

    - From the 3rd century to the 6th century, the name Sushen was [used as an alias for] the [[挹娄 (Yilou)]], who were in [eastern Manchuria]. However, the connection between the Yilou and the [ancient Sushen] is unclear. [Some historians think that] Chinese, [having heard that] the Yilou [paid arrows as tribute], [linked them with] the Sushen [based on knowledge of] [ancient documents]. They [paid tribute several times] and [pleased rulers of Northern China]. The Yilou [disappeared from documents] in the 6th century. The [[靺鞨 (Mohe)]] [rose into power] there instead.[4](((edut4dQjV)))

- The Chinese characters of the name [can also be found in] [Japanese documents], in which the characters are [annotated and read as] __Mishihase or Ashihase__. According to the [[日本书纪 (Nihon Shoki)]], the [[Mishihase]] first arrived to [Sado Province]([[佐渡 (Sado)]]) [during the reign of] [[Emperor Kimmei]]. In 660, [Japanese General] [[Abe no Hirafu]] defeated the Mishihase in Hokkaidō [by request from the native inhabitants].[5](((2o-u7dlUO)))

    - Some historians consider that the Mishihase were identical with the Sushen of [Chinese records],[6](((LozJc7nFF))) and others think that Japanese named the [indigenous people] [in the northeast] [based on the knowledge of] [Chinese documents], just as the Chinese did [during the Three Kingdoms period]. They are [generally believed to be] ethnic [[Nivkh people]] and [have influenced several later peoples in the region] such as the Wuji, Yilou and Mohe, and subsequently of the Jurchen, Manchu, Nanai and many other [[Tungusic peoples]].[7](((O0XOkDJqn)))

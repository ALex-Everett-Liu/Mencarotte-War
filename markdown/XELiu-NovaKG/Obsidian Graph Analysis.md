- # [Graph Analysis](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/graph-analysis)
    - [Analyse the structure of] your Obsidian graph [using various analysis techniques]
    - Graph analysis adds theÂ [analysis view]Â to Obsidian which [implements a set of algorithms] that [computes useful relations between the notes] [in your vault]! Our [flagship algorithm] is theÂ [Co-citationsÂ panel], that we describe as aÂ __2nd order backlinks panel__.
        - The Graph Analysis view [shows a table of] [note names and numbers], [each representing the value of] some [graph analysis algorithm] on that note [in relation to the current note].
            - e.g.
                - `[[A]] is 0.9 Similar to [[B]]`
                - [A] [has a 0.6 chance of] [being connected to] [B]
                - [A] is [co-cited with]([[co-citation]]) [B] 6 times
    - ## Analysis Types
        - Graph Analysis currently has 3 different [analysis types]:
            - Similarity
            - Link Prediction
            - Co-Citations
            - Community Detection
        - [Each implement different algorithms] [with different purposes].
        - ### Co-Citations
            - Co-Citations [counts the number of time] two notes are [cited together in the same note] and [gives extra weight]([[weight]]) [when the two notes are cited close together].
                - Think of co-citations as aÂ [2nd-order backlinksÂ panel]: Instead of showingÂ __where__Â something is cited, it showsÂ __why__, or withÂ __whom__Â orÂ __what__Â it is cited!
                    - For example, `ifÂ [[C]]Â hasÂ [[A]] and [[B]]Â in its content, thenÂ [[A]]Â andÂ [[B]]Â will each have a co-citation of one`.
            - Each note with co-citations > 0 is given a [[drop down menu]]. Inside each drop down, you can see which note [co-cites those two notes], and the sentence in which they are co-cited (if in the same sentence), otherwise just the sentence with the other link.

            - ### [Example use case]([[use case]]) with daily notes
                - An example [why this is useful] is given by @HEmile:
                    - I use a lot of [[daily note]]s, in which I [journal and write about] [the news of the day]. This makes the [backlinks panel] [a bit boring]: [It only shows] [on what dates I wrote about some note]. The [Co-Citations algorithm] [shows me much more]! For example, theÂ [Joe Biden]Â note shows me [I usually write about Biden together with]Â [Donald Trump]. [But if I want to know] [what I wrote about the relations between] [Joe Biden andÂ China], [I can just look in] the [co-citations panel] and [expand the relation to see the story]!

            - ### Video Tutorial
                - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK6JVDrGERA) gives [a longer and in depth overview] for why Co-Citations is so useful!
        - ### Similarity
            - [[similarity]] is [a measure of how similar two notes are] [based on their connectedness in the graph](((We-U6Suqk))) (ie. [note content] [is not considered]). Currently, only the Jaccard Similarity measure is implemented.
220424-19:25
        - ### Jaccard Similarity
            - [Formula](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/jaccard/#alpha-algorithms-similarity-jaccard-context): $$J(A, B)=\frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}=\frac{|A \cap B|}{|A|+|B|-|A \cap B|}$$
                - Where
                    - |x|Â is [the number of neighbours] the nodeÂ xÂ has (links [going in or out]).
                    - |x & y|Â is the number of neighbours that [bothÂ xÂ andÂ yÂ have in common]
        - ### Link Prediction
            - Link Prediction is [a measure of the probability that] [two notes should be connected] [based on their other connections in the graph]. The implemented [Link Prediction algorithms] are Adamic Adar and Common Neighbours.
            - ### Adamic Adar
                - [Formula](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/adamic-adar/): $$$$
    - ## Settings
        - In the analysis view, [you have the option to choose between] differentÂ Analysis Types, and differentÂ AlgorithmsÂ within those types. You can [set the default analysis type] in the [plugin settings].
        - [There is also the option to] [hideÂ InfinityÂ andÂ ZeroÂ values].

    - ## Documentation on Algorithms
        - [You can read more about] the [implemented algorithms], or [let us know] [which you want us to add], overÂ [here](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/)Â ðŸ‘€. Information on co-citations [can mostly be found on]Â [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-citation). In particular, we implement a variation ofÂ [Co-citatition Proximity Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-citation_Proximity_Analysis).

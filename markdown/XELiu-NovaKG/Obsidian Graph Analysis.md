    - Graph analysis adds the [analysis view] to Obsidian which [implements a set of algorithms] that [computes useful relations between the notes] [in your vault]! Our [flagship algorithm] is the [Co-citations panel], that we describe as a __2nd order backlinks panel__.
    - The Graph Analysis view [shows a table of] [note names and numbers], [each representing the value of] some [graph analysis algorithm] on that note [in relation to the current note].

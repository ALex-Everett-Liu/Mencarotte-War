- # [Graph Analysis](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/graph-analysis)
    - Graph analysis adds the [analysis view] to Obsidian which [implements a set of algorithms] that [computes useful relations between the notes] [in your vault]! Our [flagship algorithm] is the [Co-citations panel], that we describe as a __2nd order backlinks panel__.
        - The Graph Analysis view [shows a table of] [note names and numbers], [each representing the value of] some [graph analysis algorithm] on that note [in relation to the current note].
            - e.g.
                - `[[A]] is 0.9 Similar to [[B]]`
                - [A] [has a 0.6 chance of] [being connected to] [B]
                - [A] is [co-cited with]([[co-citation]]) [B] 6 times
    - ## Analysis Types
        - Graph Analysis currently has 3 different [analysis types]:
            - Similarity
            - Link Prediction
            - Co-Citations
            - Community Detection
        - [Each implement different algorithms] [with different purposes].
        - ### Co-Citations
            - Co-Citations [counts the number of time] two notes are [cited together in the same note] and [gives extra weight]([[weight]]) [when the two notes are cited close together].
                - Think of co-citations as a [2nd-order backlinks panel]: Instead of showing __where__ something is cited, it shows __why__, or with __whom__ or __what__ it is cited!
                    - For example, `if [[C]] has [[A]] and [[B]] in its content, then [[A]] and [[B]] will each have a co-citation of one`.
            - Each note with co-citations > 0 is given a [[drop down menu]]. Inside each drop down, you can see which note [co-cites those two notes], and the sentence in which they are co-cited (if in the same sentence), otherwise just the sentence with the other link.

            - ### Example use case with daily notes
                - An example why this is useful is given by @HEmile:
                - I use a lot of daily notes, in which I journal and write about the news of the day. This makes the backlinks panel a bit boring: It only shows on what dates I wrote about some note. The Co-Citations algorithm shows me much more! For example, the Joe Biden note shows me I usually write about Biden together with Donald Trump. But if I want to know what I wrote about the relations between Joe Biden and China, I can just look in the co-citations panel and expand the relation to see the story!

- ## Personality traits
    - Personality traits are the traits that [represent a character the most] and impact if and how much  [[psy/stress]] a character receives for [actions and decisions that conflict with these traits].

While personality traits can change, it is very difficult to do so; [this most often occurs as the result of] a [[mental break]] at [[stress level]] 2 or higher.
    - Each personality trait [has an opposite trait]([[opposite trait]]) and usually characters with opposite personality traits will [have lowered opinion of each other]. A character cannot have two opposing traits.

    - Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)[1] is [a technique used to] obtain an [[infrared spectrum]] of [absorption or emission of a solid], liquid or gas. An FTIR spectrometer [simultaneously collects] [high-resolution spectral data] [over a wide spectral range]. This [confers a significant advantage over] a [[dispersive spectrometer]], which [measures intensity] [over a narrow range of wavelengths] at a time.

        - The term Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy [originates from the fact that] a [[Fourier transforms (FTs)]] (a mathematical process) is required to convert the [[raw data]] into the [actual spectrum].

    - Conceptual introduction
        - The goal of [[absorption spectroscopy]] techniques (FTIR, ultraviolet-visible ("UV-Vis") spectroscopy, etc.) is to measure [how much light a sample absorbs] [at each wavelength]. [The most straightforward way] to do this, the "[[dispersive spectroscopy]]" technique, is to shine a [[monochromatic light beam]] at a sample, measure how much of the light is absorbed, and repeat for [each different wavelength]. (This is how some [UV–vis spectrometers] work, for example.) #[[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis)]]
(分光式光谱仪采用单色光照射样品，反复去测每个波长的吸收最终汇总成吸收谱，紫外-可见光光谱仪就是采用这种方法)
210705-03:05
        - Fourier-transform spectroscopy is [a less intuitive way to] [obtain the same information]. Rather than shining a monochromatic beam of light (a beam composed of only a single wavelength) at the sample, this technique shines a beam [containing many frequencies of light] at once and measures how much of that beam is absorbed by the sample. Next, [the beam is modified to] [contain a different combination of frequencies], giving a second [[data point]]. This process is [rapidly repeated many times] [over a short time span]([[time span]]). Afterwards, a computer [takes all this data] and [works backward to infer] [what the absorption is] [at each wavelength].
(首先，照射一束包含一段频段的光在样品上，完成后，再测一次不同频段组合的吸收量数据点，如此重复很多次，得到原始数据；最终通过傅里叶变换算法得到各波长处的吸收量)

            - The beam described above is generated by starting with a [broadband light source](((DGS_qpGAz)))—one containing [the full spectrum of wavelengths] to be measured. [The light shines into] a [[Michelson interferometer]]—[a certain configuration of mirrors](((ACBW7VCYb))), one of which is moved by a [[motor]]. As this mirror moves, [each wavelength of light in the beam] is [periodically blocked], transmitted, [blocked, transmitted,] by the interferometer, due to [[wave interference]]. [Different wavelengths] are [modulated at different rates], so that [at each moment] or [[mirror position]] [the beam coming out of the interferometer] [has a different spectrum].
(FTIR使用宽带光源，覆盖测量所需的全波段。迈克尔逊干涉仪周期性地允许不同波长的光通过)
            - As mentioned, [computer processing] is required to turn the [[raw data]] ([[light absorption]] for each [[mirror position]]) into the [desired result] (light absorption for each wavelength). [The processing required] [turns out to be a common algorithm] called the [[Fourier transforms (FTs)]]. The Fourier transform converts one domain (in this case [[displacement]] of the mirror in cm) into its [[inverse domain]] ([[wavenumber]]s in cm−1). The raw data is called an "[[interferogram]]".

                - An FTIR interferogram. The central peak is at the ZPD position ("[[zero path difference]]" or [[zero retardation]]), where [the maximal amount of light] passes through the interferometer to the [[detector]].
    - [[Michelson interferometer]]
    - Measuring and processing the interferogram
        - The interferogram has to be measured from zero path difference to a [maximum length] that [depends on the resolution required]([[resolution]]). [In practice] the scan [can be on either side of zero] resulting in a [double-sided interferogram]. [Mechanical design limitations] may mean that [for the highest resolution] the scan runs to the maximum OPD [on one side of zero only].
        - The [[interferogram]] is converted to a [[spectrum]] by [[Fourier transformation]]. This requires it to be [stored in digital form] as [a series of values at equal intervals] of [the path difference between the two beams]. To measure the path difference a [[laser beam]] is [sent through the interferometer], generating a [[sinusoidal signal]] where the separation between [successive maxima] 连续极大值 is [equal to the wavelength of the laser] (typically a 633 nm [[He-Ne laser]] is used). This can trigger an [[analog-to-digital converter]] to [measure the IR signal] [each time the laser signal passes through zero]. 
            - Alternatively, the laser and IR signals [can be measured synchronously] [at smaller intervals] with the [IR signal] at points [corresponding to the laser signal zero crossing](((9OXM1pi1U))) being determined by [[interpolation]].[5] [This approach allows the use of] [analog-to-digital converters] that are [more accurate and precise than] converters that can be triggered, resulting in [lower noise].

    - Advantages
        - There are three [principal advantages] for an [FT spectrometer] compared to a [[scanning spectrometer]] ([[dispersive spectrometer]]).[1]
            - The [[multiplex]] or [Fellgett's advantage]. [This arises from the fact that] [information from all wavelengths] is [collected simultaneously]. [It results in] a higher [[signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]] [for a given scan-time for observations]([[scan-time]]) limited by [a fixed detector noise contribution] (typically in the [thermal infrared spectral region] where a [[photodetector]] is limited by [[generation-recombination noise]]). For a spectrum with m [resolution elements](((zgs-0Z9WD))), this increase is [equal to the square root of m]. Alternatively, it allows a [shorter scan-time]([[scan-time]]) [for a given resolution]. In practice [multiple scans are often averaged], [increasing the signal-to-noise ratio] [by the square root of] [the number of scans]([[scan number]]). #pt9-99.99

(多路复用增益-所有波段的信息被同时收集-当检测器噪声一定时，通常是热红外光谱区的产生-复合噪声，相同扫描时间内，信噪比SNR更高 -- 信噪比与扫描次数的平方成正比)
                - 是按照[全波段][进行数据采集]的，[得到的光谱]是[对多次数据采集求平均]后的结果，而且[完成一次完整的数据采集]只需要一至数秒
            - The [[throughput]] or [Jacquinot's advantage]. [This results from the fact that] in a [dispersive instrument], the [[monochromator]] has [entrance and exit slits] which [restrict the amount of light] that passes through it. The [interferometer throughput] is [determined only by the diameter of] the [collimated beam](((9lctvsya6))) [coming from the source]. Although no [[slit]]s are needed, FTIR spectrometers do require an [[aperture]] to [restrict the convergence of the collimated beam] in the interferometer. ^^This is because [convergent rays] are [modulated at different frequencies] [as the path difference is varied].^^ Such an aperture is called a [Jacquinot stop](((UfymXqwE1))).[1] [For a given resolution and wavelength] this [[circular aperture]] [allows more light through than a slit], resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio.
211012-15:54; 220414-16:00
(光通量优势-单色仪的进出口限制了光通量-干涉仪光通量只取决于光源发出的准直光束的直径-虽然不需要狭缝，但还是需要一个孔径光阑来限制准直光束的会聚程度-当光程差变化时，会聚光束以不同频率被调制-比狭缝的进光量更多，从而信噪比更高)
                - [傅里叶变换红外光谱仪]所用的[光学元件]少，没有[光栅]或[棱镜分光器]，降低了[光的损耗]，而且通过干涉[进一步增加了光的信号]，因此[到达检测器的辐射]强度大，信噪比高。
            - The [[wavelength accuracy]] or [Connes' advantage]. The [[wavelength scale]] is [calibrated by a laser beam] of [known wavelength] that [passes through the interferometer]. This is [much more stable and accurate than] in [dispersive instruments]([[dispersive spectrometer]]) where the scale depends on the [mechanical movement] of [[diffraction grating]]s. ^^In practice, [the accuracy is limited by] [the divergence of the beam](((BeFsQalC1))) in the interferometer which [depends on the resolution]([[resolution]]).^^
(波长准确度-激光校准波长标度-而分光光度计则需要依赖衍射光栅的机械移动-分辨率决定了干涉仪中光束的会聚程度，从而限制了波长准确度)
                - 重现性好 -- 傅里叶变换红外光谱仪采用的[傅里叶变换][对光的信号进行处理]，避免了[电机驱动光栅分光]时[带来的误差]，所以[重现性]比较好，[扫描速度]快。

        - Another [minor advantage] is [less sensitivity to] [[stray light]], that is [radiation of one wavelength] [appearing at another wavelength in the spectrum]. In [dispersive instruments](((GYqf1tp6G))), this is the result of [[imperfection]]s in the diffraction gratings and [[accidental reflection]]s. In [FT instruments] [there is no direct equivalent] as the [apparent wavelength] is determined by the [[modulation frequency]] [in the interferometer].
(对杂散光的灵敏度更低-FTIR 中干涉仪的调制频率决定了表观波长，所以某一波长的辐射就不太容易出现在光谱中的其他位置)
220414-16:10
    - Spectral range
        - Far-infrared
            - The first FTIR spectrometers were developed for [[far-infrared range]]. The reason for this has to do with the [[mechanical tolerance]] needed for good [[optical performance]], which is related to [the wavelength of the light being used]. For the [relatively long wavelengths] of the far infrared, ~10 μm tolerances are adequate, whereas for the [rock-salt region] tolerances have to be better than 1 μm. A typical instrument was the [cube interferometer] developed at the NPL[9] and marketed by Grubb Parsons. It used a [[stepper motor]] to [drive the moving mirror], [recording the detector response] [after each step was completed].
        - Mid-infrared
            - [With the advent of cheap microcomputers]([[microcomputer]]) [it became possible to] [have a computer dedicated to] [controlling the spectrometer], [collecting the data](((FjXmylQov))), doing the [[Fourier transforms (FTs)]] and [presenting the spectrum]. [This provided the impetus for the development of](((AcvW7qG3V))) [FTIR spectrometers] for the [rock-salt region]. The problems of manufacturing [ultra-high precision] [optical and mechanical components] had to be solved. [A wide range of instruments] are now [available commercially]. Although [instrument design] [has become more sophisticated], the [basic principles] [remain the same]. 
            - Nowadays, the [moving mirror] of the interferometer [moves at a constant velocity], and [sampling of the interferogram] is triggered by [finding zero-crossings in the fringes of](((9OXM1pi1U))) a [secondary interferometer] lit by a [[helium–neon laser]]. In modern [FTIR systems] the [constant mirror velocity] is [not strictly required], as long as the [laser fringes] and the [original interferogram] are [recorded simultaneously] [with higher sampling rate]([[sampling rate]]) and then re-interpolated [on a constant grid], as pioneered by James W. Brault. This [confers](((bhlcFgST3))) very high [[wavenumber accuracy]] on the resulting [[infrared spectrum]] and avoids [wavenumber calibration errors].

        - Main article: [[near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)]] 
            - The near-infrared region [spans the wavelength range between] the [[rock-salt region]] and the start of the [[visible region]] [at about 750 nm]. [[overtone]]s of [[fundamental vibration]]s [can be observed in this region]. [It is used mainly in] [industrial applications] such as [[process control]] and [[chemical imaging]].

    - Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is [a technique for estimating] [the infrared spectrum of emission], or of adsorption, of a compound. [The FTIR method] uses a "moving mirror" Michelson interferometer, rather than a diffraction grating, to [split the infrared radiation into] its frequencies. This method [captures all the incident infrared radiation] thus [providing very high energy]. The [moving mirror position]([[moving mirror]]) is referenced against a [[HeNe laser]] also [providing high frequency accuracy]([[wavenumber accuracy]]). The frequencies for a typical FTIR spectrometer range from about 8000 to 400 cm-1 (wavenumbers) which includes part of the [near-infrared (NIR)] and [all of the mid-infrared (MIR)]. Because of this [high energy throughput](((Q6Mxlb3aK))), MIR diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) spectroscopy [becomes an efficient option for] rapidly scanning powdered samples.

        - 1. The infrared beam is simply focussed onto or through the sample.
        - 2. The reflected beam is split by the Michelson interferometer with one fixed and one moving mirror.
        - 3. As the moving mirror changes position we get interference.
        - 4. The position is referenced against a HeNe laser interference pattern.
        - 5. Each wavelength contributes to the interference pattern.
        - 6. The interferogram is then transformed with a Fourier Transform function to obtain a spectrum.

        - ### **FT-NIR** [Process Monitoring](((CpOjxGjPN)))
            - Today many manufacturers are [striving not only to produce] the [highest quality] [[final product]] but also to improve [[manufacturing efficiency]] by shifting the final [[quality analysis]] from the [[laboratory]] to the [[production plant]]s. [This will help to reduce] the [[labor cost]]s, but also allow [redeploying skilled staff into] [more demanding engineering roles].

            - __Check important process parameters immediately for reaction monitoring and control. Fiber-coupled probes and sensor heads allow a direct look into the process without time delay.__
            - By integrating real-time process analysis into the manufacturing processes, it is possible to optimize the use of materials, increase the overall equipment efficiency and reduce or eliminate the production of off-specification batches, thus saving reprocessing or disposal costs.
            - Moreover, stringent regulations are demanding greater traceability throughout the manufacturing process, today already in the pharmaceutical industry, but soon also on other industries, like food production.
        - ### **[Key Benefits of] Bruker's [FT-NIR Solutions]**
            - All Bruker [[process spectrometer]]s are characterized by [[robustness]], long-term [[stability]], and low [[maintenance cost]]s. Thousands of [[installation]]s in the chemical, petrochemical and [polymer industry] as well as in [pharmaceutical production processes] and in the field of [food and feed manufacturing] [prove our experience].
220413-11:10
        - ### Ongoing Cost Optimization
            - To the cost of a conventional analysis (consumables, maintenance and labor costs), very often the cost of unrealized profits as well as losses due to faulty batches and their disposal must be added.
            - FT-NIR online analysis on the other hand needs an initial investment for the spectrometer, process probes and accessories, as well as labor costs for the calibration development, but marginal running costs for labor and maintenance. Moreover, the process can be optimized, reaction yields can be maximized, and faulty batches can be prevented making unrealized profit a thing of the past.
        - ### Rocksolid Design
            - [Bruker's patented](https://www.spectroscopy-in-process.com/img/cip/cubecorner.jpg) RockSolid™ interferometer with [Cube Corner mirrors]([[cube corner reflector]]) guarantees [ultra-precise light guidance](((ylWuM2pbw))), a precondition for [reliable analysis results]. In combination with the [permanent alignment](((dnIj4DSCV))) [utilizing an internal laser], the [MATRIX-F process spectrometers] are [highly operational] [even under harsh conditions]([[harsh condition]]).

        - ### Simultaneous Multi Component Analysis
            - FT-NIR spectroscopy [provides a rapid method for] [analysis of several components simultaneously] [based a one single measurement], since [the resulting spectrum] [contains the unique information from] the [vibrational absorption bands](((06tWaJI31))) of each molecule.

        - Multiplexing Advantage
            - With Bruker’s [multi-channel process spectrometer] MATRIX-F [up to 6 locations can be monitored], [reducing the cost per] [[measurement point]]. The [[probe]]s, [[flow cell]]s or [[sensor head]]s are [mounted directly into the reactor]([[reactor]]) 直接安装在反应器中 and [transmitting the light over long distances] (> 100 m) by using [[fiber optical cable]]s.

        - ## [How FTIR works?](https://www.gasmet.com/products/technology/ftir-fourier-transform-infrared/)
            - All molecules can be identified by their characteristic absorption spectrum because each molecule absorbs infrared radiation at its characteristic frequencies. Every molecular structure has a unique combination of atoms, and therefore produces a unique spectrum when exposed to infrared light. Even molecules with the same number of atoms in different positions can be distinguished. The only exceptions are diatomic elements such as O2 and noble gases, which do not absorb in the IR. IR absorption spectrum can be thought of as a fingerprint unique to each molecule.
            - ### Difference between IR Technologies
                - [Non-Dispersive IR instruments (NDIR)]([[nondispersive infrared sensor (NDIR)]]) measure only [separate wavelength bands], no information from [other parts of the spectrum]. [Only one component can be analyzed] [from a single measurement] and [interference cannot be compensated].
                - Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer [measures all the IR wavelengths simultaneously] and [produces a full spectrum]. [All components can be analyzed] from a single measurement and [interferences are resolved].
        - ## FTIR Gas Analyzers
            - Gasmet manufactures [portable FTIR gas analyzers](https://www.gasmet.com/products/category/portable-gas-analyzers/) and [stationary FTIR emissions monitoring systems](https://www.gasmet.com/products/category/emission-monitoring-systems/). An FTIR analyzer works by simultaneously scanning the entire infrared spectrum. Then, the software calculates the concentrations of each gas in the sample based on the characteristic absorption. All the gases in the sample can be measured simultaneously because the entire infrared spectrum is scanned at once. This allows for very quick multicomponent measurements and for compensation for any cross-interference.
            - As all gases are measured by scanning the same infrared spectrum, adding new compounds can be done easily in the software without requiring any changes to the hardware. The recorded spectra are also unaltered by the analysis performed on them and can therefore always be re-analyzed. This allows for traceable data and facilitates for instance retrospectively checking the measurements for new gases.
            - All this makes FTIR the ideal solution for a variety of applications where multiple gases need to be measured quickly, accurately and reliably.

- Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)[1] is [a technique used to] obtain an [[infrared spectrum]] of [absorption or emission of a solid], liquid or gas. An FTIR spectrometer simultaneously collects [high-resolution spectral data] [over a wide spectral range]. This confers a significant advantage over a [[dispersive spectrometer]], which measures intensity over a narrow range of wavelengths at a time.

    - The term Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy [originates from the fact that] a [[Fourier transforms (FTs)]] (a mathematical process) is required to convert the [[raw data]] into the [actual spectrum].

- Conceptual introduction
    - The goal of [[absorption spectroscopy]] techniques (FTIR, ultraviolet-visible ("UV-Vis") spectroscopy, etc.) is to measure how much light a sample absorbs at each wavelength. The most straightforward way to do this, the "[[dispersive spectroscopy]]" technique, is to shine a [[monochromatic light beam]] at a sample, measure how much of the light is absorbed, and repeat for each different wavelength. (This is how some UV–vis spectrometers work, for example.) #[[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis)]]

    - Fourier-transform spectroscopy is [a less intuitive way to] [obtain the same information]. Rather than shining a monochromatic beam of light (a beam composed of only a single wavelength) at the sample, this technique shines a beam [containing many frequencies of light] at once and measures how much of that beam is absorbed by the sample. Next, [the beam is modified to] [contain a different combination of frequencies], giving a second [[data point]]. This process is [rapidly repeated many times] [over a short time span]([[time span]]). Afterwards, a computer takes all this data and works backward to infer what the absorption is at each wavelength.

        - The beam described above is generated by starting with a [broadband light source](((DGS_qpGAz)))—one containing the full spectrum of wavelengths to be measured. The light shines into a [[Michelson interferometer]]—[a certain configuration of mirrors](((ACBW7VCYb))), one of which is moved by a [[motor]]. As this mirror moves, each wavelength of light in the beam is periodically blocked, transmitted, blocked, transmitted, by the interferometer, due to [[wave interference]]. [Different wavelengths] are [modulated at different rates], so that at each moment or mirror position [the beam coming out of the interferometer] [has a different spectrum].

        - As mentioned, computer processing is required to turn the raw data ([[light absorption]] for each [[mirror position]]) into the desired result (light absorption for each wavelength). [The processing required] [turns out to be a common algorithm] called the [[Fourier transform]]. The Fourier transform converts one domain (in this case [[displacement]] of the mirror in cm) into its [[inverse domain]] ([[wavenumber]]s in cm−1). The raw data is called an "[[interferogram]]".

- Spectral range
    - Far-infrared
        - The first FTIR spectrometers were developed for [[far-infrared range]]. The reason for this has to do with the [[mechanical tolerance]] needed for good [[optical performance]], which is related to [the wavelength of the light being used]. For the relatively long wavelengths of the far infrared, ~10 μm tolerances are adequate, whereas for the rock-salt region tolerances have to be better than 1 μm. A typical instrument was the cube interferometer developed at the NPL[9] and marketed by Grubb Parsons. It used a [[stepper motor]] to [drive the moving mirror], [recording the detector response] [after each step was completed].

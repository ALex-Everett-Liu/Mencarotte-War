- Continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) are used as a tool to monitor the [effluent gas streams] resulting from [[combustion]] in [[industrial process]]es. CEMS can measure [[flue gas]] for [[oxygen]], [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]] to [provide information for] [[combustion control]] in [[industrial settings]].[1] [2]They are also used as a means to comply with [[air emission standard]]s such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Acid Rain Program,[3] other US federal emission programs, or state permitted emission standards. 
    - CEMS typically consist of [[analyzer]]s to measure [[gas concentration]]s within the stream, equipment to direct a sample of that [[gas stream]] to the analyzers [if they are remote], equipment to [condition the sample gas by](((bbZEcva84))) [removing water and other components] that could [interfere with the reading](((7oe5A25j1))), 其他可能干扰读数的成分 [pneumatic plumbing with valves] 带阀门的气动管道 that can be controlled by a [[programmable logic controller (PLC)]] to [route the sample gas to and away from]([[sample gas]]) the analyzers, a [calibration and maintenance system](((FSMdqAh5X))) that allows for the injection of [[calibration gas]]es into the [[sample line]], and a [[Data Acquisition and Handling System (DAHS)]] that collects and stores each [[data point]] and can [perform necessary calculations required to] get [[total mass emission]]s. A CEMS [operates at all times] even if [the process it measures] is not on. They can continuously collect, record and report [[emissions data]] for [process monitoring] and/or [for compliance purposes]. 合规性

    - The standard CEM system consists of a [[sample probe]], [[filter]], [[sample line]] (umbilical), 近脐带 [[gas conditioning system]], [[calibration gas system]], and a series of [[gas analyzer]]s which [reflect the parameters being monitored]. Typical [monitored emissions] include: [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, [[hydrogen chloride]], [[airborne particulate matter]], 空气颗粒物 [[mercury]], [[Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)]], and oxygen. CEM systems can also measure [[air flow]], [[flue gas opacity]] and [[moisture]]. A [[monitoring system]] that [measures particulate matter] is referred to as a [[PEMS]].

    - In the U.S., the EPA requires a data acquisition and handling system to [collect and report the data]. Measurements of [[concentration]] [can be converted to mass/hour] by including [[flow rate]] measurements. 流量测量值 The types of gases being measured and the [calculations required] are [dependent upon the source type] and each source type [has its own subpart] under 40 CFR part 60 and part 75.[4] 
        - [SO2 emissions] are measured in [pounds per hour] using both an [SO2 pollutant concentration monitor] and a [volumetric flow monitor]. For NOx, both a NOx pollutant concentration monitor and a diluent gas monitor are used to determine the emissions rate in weight per volume or weight per heat value (for example lbs/million Btu, lbs/ft3, kg/kWh or kg/m3). Opacity measurements are sometimes required, depending on the source type. CO2 measuring is sometimes a requirement, however if monitored, a CO2 or oxygen monitor plus a flow monitor should be used. 
        - The DAHS must be able to collect, record and store data, ^^usually [at 1-minute intervals].^^ For compliance purposes, a DAHS must be **[in continuous operation 24/7/365]** [even when no process is on]. For a valid measurement, the DAHS [must record at least one reading] every 15 minutes for 3 out of 4 quarters. The [[reading]]s are then [averaged hourly].[5]
- Operation
    - A small sample of flue gas is extracted, by means of a [[pump]], into the CEM system via a sample probe. Facilities that combust [[fossil fuel]]s often use a dilution-extractive probe 稀释-萃取探针 to [[dilute the sample]] with clean, [[dry air]] to a ratio typically between 50:1 to 200:1, but usually 100:1. Dilution is used because pure flue gas can be hot, wet and, with some pollutants, sticky. Once diluted to the appropriate ratio, the sample is transported through a sample line (typically referred to as an umbilical) to a manifold from which individual analyzers may extract a sample. Gas analyzers employ various techniques to accurately measure concentrations. Some commonly used techniques include: infrared and ultraviolet adsorption, chemiluminescence, fluorescence and beta ray absorption. After analysis, the gas exits the analyzer to a common manifold to all analyzers where it is vented out of doors. A Data Acquisition and Handling System (DAHS) receives the signal output from each analyzer in order to collect and record emissions data.[6]
    - Another sample extraction method used in industrial sources and utility sources with low emission rates, is commonly referred to as a "dry extractive", "hot dry" extractive, or "direct" CEMS. The sample is not diluted, but is carried along a heated sample line at high temperature into a sample conditioning unit. The sample is filtered to remove particulate matter and dried, usually with a chiller, to remove moisture. Once conditioned, the sample enters a sampling manifold and is measured by various gas analyzers, typically NOx and O2 (and sometimes CO) for combustion turbines and engines running natural gas or diesel. NOx analyzers typically work using chemiluminescence. O2 analyzers a magnetic field which attracts O2 to measure the concentration. The O2 causes movement of a suspended mirror within the analyzer which then changes the amount of light being reflected by that mirror onto a photocell. The amount of current required to move the mirror back to center is proportional to the O2 concentration. The ability to measure % oxygen in the sample is required to perform the required calculations.

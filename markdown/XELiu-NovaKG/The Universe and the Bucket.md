- It's not often that [a bucket of water]([[water bucket experiment]]) is [the central character in] [a three-hundred-year-long debate]. But a bucket that belonged to [Sir Isaac Newton] is [no ordinary bucket], and [a little experiment] he described in 1689 [has deeply influenced] some of [the world's greatest physicists] ever since. The experiment is this: Take a bucket filled with water, hang it by a rope, [twist the rope tightly] so that [it's ready to unwind], and let it go. At first, the bucket [starts to spin] but the water inside [remains fairly stationary]; the surface of the [stationary water] [stays nice and flat]. As the bucket [picks up speed], little by little its motion is [communicated to the water] by friction, and the water starts to spin too. As it does, the water's surface [takes on a concave shape](((_u-EvXS-0))), 水面呈凹形 higher at the rim and lower in the center, as in Figure 2.1.
(水桶的转动通过摩擦力传递给水-水的表面呈凹形持续地旋转)
    - That's the experiment—[not quite something that] [gets the heart racing]. 让人心跳加速 But [a little thought will show that] [this bucket of spinning water](((GKhwdZJBm))) is extremely puzzling. And coming to grips with it, as we [have not yet done] in over three centuries, [ranks among the most important steps toward] [grasping the structure of the universe](((fWPz22p8I))). Understanding why will [take some background], but it is well [worth the effort].
    - **Figure 2.1** [The surface of the water] [starts out flat] and remains so [as the bucket starts to spin]. Subsequently, as the water also starts to spin, its surface becomes concave, and it [remains concave] [while the water spins], even as the bucket [slows and stops].
- ## Relativity Before Einstein
    - "Relativity" is a word we [associate with Einstein], but the concept [goes much further back]. Galileo, Newton, and many others were [well aware that] [[velocity]] — [the speed and direction of an object's motion](((Ndc5Aj0zR))) —is relative. In modern terms, from the batter's point of view, [a well-pitched fastball] 一个投得好的快球 [might be approaching at] 100 miles per hour. From the baseball's [point of view], it's the batter who is approaching at 100 miles per hour. Both descriptions are accurate; it's just [a matter of perspective](((I09zrPaL2))). Motion has meaning only [in a relational sense]: [An object's velocity] [can be specified only in relation to] that of another object. You've probably experienced this. [When the train you are on] is next to another and you see [[relative motion]], [you can't immediately tell] which train is actually [moving on the tracks]. 
        - Galileo [described this effect] [using the transport of his day], boats. [Drop a coin] [on a smoothly sailing ship], Galileo said, and [it will hit your foot] [just as it would] [on dry land]. From your perspective, [you are justified in declaring that] you are stationary and it's the water that is [rushing by the ship's hull]. And since [from this point of view] [you are not moving], [the coin's motion](((IZ2IXnBb4))) relative to your foot [will be exactly what it would have been] [before you embarked]. 在你上船之前
(一个物体的速度只有在比较与其它物体的相对关系时才能被确定下来--在船上抛下的硬币-由于船上的你是静止的，硬币的运动与通常情况不会有任何差别)
        - Of course, [there are circumstances under which](((1rKKMwl-2))) your motion [seems intrinsic](((nOhvKZ5_K))), [when you can feel it] and [you seem able to declare], without [recourse to external comparisons], 无需依赖于与外部环境的比较 that you are definitely moving. This is the case with [[accelerated motion]], motion in which your speed and/or your direction changes. If [the boat you are on] [suddenly lurches one way or another], or slows down or speeds up, or [changes direction by rounding a bend], or [gets caught in a whirlpool] and [spins around and around], you know that you are moving. And you realize this without looking out and [comparing your motion with] [some chosen point of reference]([[reference point]]). Even if [your eyes are closed], you know you're moving, because you feel it. Thus, while you can't feel motion with [[constant speed]] that [heads in an unchanging straight-line trajectory]—[[constant velocity motion]], it's called—you can feel [changes to your velocity].
(在加速运动中，你能够明确感觉到你正在运动)
        - But if you think about it for a moment, there is something odd about this. What is it about changes in velocity that allows them to stand alone, to have [intrinsic meaning]? If velocity is something that [makes sense only by comparisons] —by saying that this is moving [with respect to that](((PfykFUQUr)))— how is it that changes in velocity are somehow different, and don't also [require comparisons to] [give them meaning]? In fact, could it be that they actually do [require a comparison to be made]? Could it be that there is some [implicit or hidden comparison] that is [actually at work] [every time we refer to] or [experience accelerated motion]? This is a [central question] we're heading toward because, perhaps surprisingly, it [touches on the deepest issues] [surrounding the meaning of] [space and time].
(速度的意义是需要在比较中确定的，不存在一个固有速度)
    - Galileo's insights about motion, most notably his assertion that [the earth itself moves], [brought upon him the wrath of] [the Inquisition](((aKDfqxZQs))). 引起了宗教裁判所的愤怒 A more cautious [[Descartes]], in his [[Principia Philosophiae]] (Principles of Philosophy), sought to [avoid a similar fate] and [couched his understanding of] motion [in an equivocating framework] 在一个模棱两可的框架中阐述了 that [could not stand up to the close scrutiny] 经不起严密的审查 Newton gave it some thirty years later. Descartes spoke about objects' [having a resistance to changes to their state of motion]: [something that is motionless] [will stay motionless unless] [someone or something forces it to move]; something that is [moving in a straight line] [at constant speed] will [maintain that motion] until [someone or something forces it to change]. 
        - But what, Newton asked, do these notions of "motionless" or "straight line at constant speed" really mean? Motionless or constant speed [with respect to what]? Motionless or constant speed [from whose viewpoint](((I09zrPaL2)))? If velocity is not constant, **with respect to what or from whose viewpoint is it not constant?** Descartes [correctly teased out] [aspects of motion's meaning], 梳理出运动意义的各个方面 but Newton realized that he [left key questions unanswered].

        - Newton —a man so [driven by the pursuit of truth] that he once [shoved a blunt needle] 插入一根钝针 [between his eye and the socket bone] 眼窝骨 to study [ocular anatomy](((0OuAnr570))) and, later in life as [[Master of the Mint]], [meted out the harshest of punishments to] 最严厉的惩罚 counterfeiters, 造假者 sending more than a hundred to the gallows 绞刑架—[had no tolerance for] [false or incomplete reasoning]. So he decided to [set the record straight](((x4jUEtKks))). This led him to introduce the bucket.[1]
- ## The Bucket
    - When we left the bucket, [both it and the water within] were spinning, with [the water's surface] [forming a concave shape]. [The issue Newton raised](((23-g_XxGE))) is, Why does the water's surface [take this shape]? Well, because it's spinning, you say, and just as we [feel pressed against the side of a car] [when it takes a sharp turn], the water [gets pressed against] [the side of the bucket] as it spins. __And the [only place for] the [pressed water] to go is upward.__ [This reasoning is sound], as far as it goes, but it [misses the real intent of] Newton's question. He [wanted to know] [what it means to say that] the water is spinning: spinning with respect to what? Newton was [grappling with](((IWUCejNez))) [the very foundation of motion] and was [far from ready to accept that] accelerated motion such as spinning—is [somehow beyond the need for] [[external comparison]]s.*
(水受到了内壁的挤压，只能向上走-我们真正想问的是，为什么旋转运动产生了离心力和向心力)
210406-04:25
        - * The terms [[centrifugal force]] and [[centripetal force]] are [sometimes used] when describing [[spinning motion]]. But they are merely labels. Our intent is to understand why spinning motion [gives rise to force].
        - [Agglomeration equilibrium] 集聚均衡 is the result of [the interaction of centrifugal force and centripetal force]. www.[fabiao].net
    - [A natural suggestion is to] [use the bucket itself as] [the object of reference]([[reference object]]). But, as Newton argued, this fails. You see, at first when we [let the bucket start to spin], there is definitely [[relative motion]] [between the bucket and the water], because the water [does not immediately move]. Even so, [the surface of the water] [stays flat]. Then, a little later, [when the water is spinning] and there isn't relative motion between the bucket and the water, the surface of the water is concave. So, with the bucket as our [object of reference], we [get exactly the opposite of] [what we expect]: when there is relative motion, the water's surface is flat; and when there is no relative motion, the surface is concave.
(如果以水桶本身作为参考系，只能得到相反的结论)
        - In fact, we can take [[Newton's bucket experiment]] [one small step further]. As the bucket continues to spin, [the rope will twist again](((GAeoO1NQM))) (in the other direction), causing the bucket to slow down and [momentarily come to rest], 瞬时 while [the water inside] [continues to spin]. At this point, the relative motion between the water and the bucket is the same as it was [near the very beginning of the experiment] (except for [the inconsequential difference of] [clockwise vs. counterclockwise motion]), but [the shape of the water's surface] is different (previously being flat, now being concave); ^^this [shows conclusively that] the relative motion [cannot explain the surface's shape]^^.
(拧转绳子使得水桶停下来，由于水仍然在旋转，因而仍旧存在相对运动，但此时的水面不是平的而是凸的——开头的解释失效了)
    - Having ruled out the bucket as a [[relevant reference]] for the motion of the water, Newton boldly 大胆地 [took the next step]. Imagine, he suggested, [another version of] the [spinning bucket experiment] carried out in deep, cold, completely [[empty space]]. We can't [run exactly the same experiment], since the shape of the water's surface [depended in part on] [the pull of earth's gravity], and [in this version] [the earth is absent]. So, to [create a more workable example], let's imagine [we have a huge bucket]—one as large as any [amusement park ride] 游乐场游乐设施 —that is [floating in the darkness of empty space], and imagine that [a fearless astronaut], Homer, is strapped to the bucket's [[interior wall]]. (Newton didn't actually use this example; he suggested using [two rocks tied together by a rope], but the point is the same.) The [telltale sign](((u6mRipimL))) that [the bucket is spinning], ^^the analog of [the water being pushed outward]^^ [yielding a concave surface]([[concave surface]]), is that Homer will [feel pressed against] [the inside of the bucket], his [facial skin] [pulling taut], 他的面部皮肤绷紧 his stomach slightly compressing, and his hair (both strands) [straining back toward the bucket wall]. Here is the question: in totally empty space —no sun, no earth, no air, no doughnuts, no anything —[what could possibly serve as] the "something" [with respect to which] [the bucket is spinning]? At first, since we are [imagining space is completely empty] [except for the bucket and its contents], [it looks as if] [there simply isn't anything else to] [serve as the something]. Newton disagreed.

        - He answered by fixing on 确定 the [ultimate container] as the [[relevant frame of reference]]: space itself. He proposed that the transparent, [empty arena] [in which we are all immersed] and within which [all motion takes place] exists as a real, [[physical entity]], which he called [[absolute space]].[2] We can't [grab or clutch absolute space], we can't [taste or smell or hear] absolute space, but nevertheless Newton declared that absolute space is a something. It's the something, he proposed, that [provides the truest reference for] [describing motion]. [An object is truly at rest] [when it is at rest] [with respect to absolute space]. An object is truly moving when it is [moving with respect to absolute space]. And, most important, Newton concluded, an object is truly accelerating when it is accelerating with respect to absolute space.
(静止/运动/加速运动的物体在相对于绝对空间时才是真正静止/运动/加速运动的)
210406-05:32
        - Newton [used this proposal to explain] the [terrestrial bucket experiment] [in the following way]. At the beginning of the experiment, the bucket is spinning with respect to absolute space, but [the water is stationary](((7ED9Xcewm))) [with respect to absolute space]. That's why [the water's surface is flat]. 一开始水相对于绝对空间是静止的，因而水面是平的 As the water [catches up with the bucket], it is now [spinning with respect to absolute space], and that's why [its surface becomes concave]. [As the bucket slows] because of [the tightening rope], 拧紧的 the water [continues to spin] —spinning with respect to absolute space —and that's why its surface [continues to be concave]. And so, whereas [relative motion between] the water and the bucket cannot [account for the observations], relative motion between the water and absolute space can. Space itself [provides the true frame of reference for] [defining motion].
(当水面相对于绝对空间是旋转的时候，水面就呈现凸形-只有当绝对空间作为参考系的时候，才真正定义了运动的概念)
        - The bucket is but an example; the reasoning is of course far more general. According to Newton's perspective, when you [round the bend in a car], you [feel the change in your velocity] because you are [accelerating with respect to absolute space]. When [the plane you are on](((P1F2OLwH3))) is [gearing up for takeoff], 准备起飞 you [feel pressed back in your seat] because you are accelerating with respect to absolute space. When you [spin around on ice skates], 溜冰 you feel [your arms being flung outward] because you are accelerating with respect to absolute space. By contrast, if someone were able to [spin the entire ice arena] [while you stood still] (assuming the [[idealized situation]] of [frictionless skates](((uPrTveiWj))))—giving rise to the same relative motion between you and the ice—you would not [feel your arms flung outward], because you would not be accelerating with respect to absolute space. And, just to make sure you don't [get sidetracked by] [the irrelevant details of examples] that [use the human body], when Newton's [two rocks tied together by a rope] [twirl around in empty space], [the rope pulls taut] because the rocks are accelerating with respect to absolute space. Absolute space [has the final word on] [what it means to move]. 最终决定权, 一锤定音
210406-07:42
    - But what is absolute space, really? In [dealing with this question], Newton [responded with a bit of fancy footwork] and [the force of fiat]. He first wrote in the [Principia](((hVQgmcu_G))) "I do not define time, space, place, and motion, as [they] are well known to all,"[3] [sidestepping any attempt to] 横跨, 回避 [describe these concepts with rigor or precision]. His next words have become famous: "Absolute space, in its own nature, [without reference to] anything external, remains always similar and immovable." That is, absolute space just is, and is forever. Period. 就是这么回事儿 But [there are glimmers that] Newton was [not completely comfortable with] [simply declaring the existence] and importance of something that [you can't directly see], measure, or affect. He wrote,
        - > It is indeed [a matter of great difficulty to] discover and effectually to distinguish [the true motions of particular bodies] from the apparent, because the parts of that [immovable space] [in which those motions are performed] do by no means [come under the observations of our senses].[4]
    - So Newton leaves us in [a somewhat awkward position]. He puts absolute space [front and center in the description of] [the most basic and essential element] of physics —motion—but he [leaves its definition vague] and [acknowledges his own discomfort about] [placing such an important egg in] [such an elusive basket]. Many others have [shared this discomfort].

- ## Space Jam
    - Einstein [once said that] [if someone uses words like] "red," "hard," or "disappointed," [we all basically know] [what is meant]. But as for the word "space," "whose relation with [[psychological experience]] is less direct, there exists [a far-reaching uncertainty of interpretation]."' This uncertainty reaches far back: [the struggle to come to grips with the meaning of] space is [an ancient one]. Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius, Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and [many of their followers through the ages] [wrestled in one way or another] with the meaning of "space." [Is there a difference between] space and matter? Does space [have an existence independent of] [the presence of material objects]? 实物的存在 Is there [such a thing as] empty space? Are space and matter [[mutually exclusive]]? Is space finite or infinite? 
        - For millennia, [the philosophical parsings of](((1DoKqIeFf))) space often [arose in tandem with] [theological inquiries]. 伴随着 God, according to some, is [[omnipresent]], an idea that [gives space a divine character]. [This line of reasoning] was advanced by 推理路线 [[Henry More]], a seventeenth-century [theologian/philosopher] who, some think, may have been one of Newton's mentors.[6] He believed that [if space were empty] [it would not exist], but [he also argued that] this is an [irrelevant observation] because, even when devoid of [[material object]]s, space is [filled with spirit], so it is never truly empty. Newton himself [took on a version of] this idea, [allowing space to be filled by] "[[spiritual substance]]" as well as [[material substance]], but [he was careful to add that] [such spiritual stuff] "[can be no obstacle to] [the motion of matter]; no more than if [nothing were in its way]."[7] Absolute space, Newton declared, is [the sensorium of God]. 神志, 感觉

        - Such [philosophical and religious musings] 冥思 on space [can be compelling and provocative], yet, as in Einstein's [cautionary remark](((_-BXOCxIa))) above, they lack [a critical sharpness of description]. But there is [a fundamental and precisely framed question] that [emerges from such discourse]: should we [ascribe an independent reality to] space, as we do for other, [more ordinary material objects] like [the book you are now holding], or should we think of space as [merely a language for] [describing relationships between] ordinary material objects?
            - The great [German philosopher] [[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]], who was Newton's contemporary, [firmly believed that] space [does not exist in any conventional sense]. 传统意义 Talk of space, he claimed, is [nothing more than] [an easy and convenient way of] encoding [where things are relative to one another]. But without the objects in space, space itself [has no independent meaning or existence](((hSSedE0Wg))). Think of the [English alphabet]([[alphabet]]). It [provides an order for] [twenty-six letters](((l6aSbCGxR))) — it [provides relations such as] a is next to b, d is six letters before /', x is three letters after u, and so on. But without the letters, the alphabet [has no meaning]—it has no "supra-letter," [[independent existence]]. Instead, the alphabet [comes into being with] the letters whose [[lexicographic relation]]s it supplies. Leibniz claimed that [the same is true for] space: Space [has no meaning beyond] [providing the natural language for] [discussing the relationship between] [one object's location] and another. According to Leibniz, ^^if all objects were [removed from space] —if space were [completely empty]—[it would be as meaningless as] an alphabet that's [missing its letters].^^ #pt10-100
(莱布尼茨则认为，空间这个概念不过是代指/定义事物间联系的一种方式而已-没有物体本身，空间的概念就没有任何意义-如果没有任何物体，那么也就无需定义任何物体的位置，从而也不需要定义空间的存在)
(这不就是范畴论的思路了吗)
210406-09:20
                - Leibniz [put forward a number of arguments] in support of this so-called [[relationist position]]. For example, he argued that if space really [exists as an entity](((z2tQi4CgP))), as a [background substance], God [would have had to choose] where in this substance to [place the universe]. But how could God, whose decisions all [have sound justification] 他的决定都有正当的理由 and are [never random or haphazard], have possibly distinguished one location [in the uniform void of] [empty space] from another, as they are all alike? To the [scientifically receptive ear], 愿意倾听的, 乐于接受的 this argument sounds tinny. But if we remove the [theological element], as Leibniz himself did [in other arguments he put forward], we are left with [thorny issues](((N6myRIVcL))): ^^What is the location of the universe within space?^^ If the universe were to [move as a whole] —leaving all [[relative position]]s of [[material object]]s 完整无缺 intact—ten feet to the left or right, how would we know? What is the speed of the [entire universe] through [the substance of space]? If we are [fundamentally unable to detect] space, or [changes within space], [how can we claim] it [actually exists]?

                    - It is here that Newton [stepped in with his bucket] and dramatically [changed the character of the debate]. 改变了辩论的性质 While Newton agreed that [certain features of] absolute space seem difficult or perhaps [impossible to detect directly], he argued that [the existence of absolute space] [does have consequences that are observable]([[observable consequence]]): [[acceleration]]s, such as those at play [in the rotating bucket], are accelerations with respect to absolute space. Thus, the [concave shape] of the water, according to Newton, is a consequence of [the existence of absolute space]. And Newton argued that [once one has any solid evidence for] [something's existence], no matter how indirect, that [ends the discussion]. In one [clever stroke], Newton [shifted the debate] about space from [philosophical ponderings] to [scientifically verifiable data]. The effect was palpable. 可触摸感知的 [In due course], Leibniz was [forced to admit], "I grant [there is a difference between] [absolute true motion of a body] and [a mere relative change of its situation] [with respect to another body]."[8] [This was not a capitulation to] [Newton's absolute space], but it was [a strong blow to] 打击 the firm relationist position.
(可以被实际检验的证据：加速度)
                    - During the next two hundred years, the arguments of Leibniz and others against [assigning space an independent reality] [generated hardly an echo] [in the scientific community].[9] Instead, [the pendulum had clearly swung to](((OUlzIaN6k))) [Newton's view of space]; his [laws of motion](((Jid5U4nGy))), [founded on his concept of] absolute space, took center stage. Certainly, [the success of these laws] in [describing observations] was the [essential reason] for their acceptance. It's striking to note, 引人注目的 however, that Newton himself viewed [all of his achievements in] physics as merely [forming the solid foundation to] support [what he considered] his really [important discover])': absolute space. For Newton, it was all about space.[10]

- ## Mach and the Meaning of Space
    - When I was growing up, I used to [play a game with my father] as we [walked down the streets] of Manhattan. One of us would look around, [secretly fix on something] that was happening—a bus rushing by, a pigeon [landing on a windowsill], a man accidentally [dropping a coin] —and [describe how it would look] [from an unusual perspective](((I09zrPaL2))) such as [the wheel of the bus], the pigeon in flight, or the quarter [falling earthward]. [The challenge was to] [take an unfamiliar description] like "I'm walking on a dark, [cylindrical surface] surrounded by low, textured walls, and [an unruly bunch of] [thick white tendrils] 一束不规则的厚厚的白色卷须 is [descending from the sky]," and figure out that it was [the view of an ant] [walking on a hot dog] that a [street vendor] 街头小贩 was [garnishing with sauerkraut]. 用德式酸椰菜/泡菜来配菜 Although we [stopped playing years] before I [took my first physics course], the game is [at least partly to blame for] my [having a fair amount of distress] [when I encountered Newton's laws]. The game encouraged [seeing the world from different vantage points] 有利地位 and emphasized that each was [as valid as any other]. 
        - But according to Newton, [while you are certainly free to] [contemplate the world] from [any perspective you choose], the different vantage points are [by no means] [on an equal footing]. [From the viewpoint of] an ant [on an ice skater's boot], it is the ice and the arena that are spinning; from the viewpoint of [a spectator in the stands], it is the ice skater that is spinning. The two [vantage points] [seem to be equally valid], they seem to be [on an equal footing], they seem to stand in the [symmetric relationship] of each spinning with respect to the other. Yet, according to Newton, one of these perspectives is [more right than the other] since if it really is the [ice skater] that is spinning, his or her arms will splay outward, 向外展开 whereas if it really is the arena that is spinning, his or her arms will not. 
        - Accepting [Newton's absolute space] meant accepting [an absolute conception of acceleration](((A9dYpN98c))), and, in particular, [accepting an absolute answer] regarding [who or what is really spinning]. I [struggled to understand] [how this could possibly be true]. Every source I consulted —textbooks and teachers alike —^^agreed that only relative motion had relevance when considering [constant velocity motion], so why in the world, I endlessly puzzled, would accelerated motion be so different?^^ Why wouldn't [[relative acceleration]], like [[relative velocity]], [be the only thing that's relevant] when considering [motion at velocity that isn't constant]? The existence of absolute space decreed otherwise, but to me this [seemed thoroughly peculiar].

    - Much later I learned that over the last few hundred years many physicists and philosophers —sometimes loudly, sometimes quietly—had struggled with the very same issue. Although Newton's bucket seemed to show definitively that absolute space is what selects one perspective over another (if someone or something is spinning with respect to absolute space then they are really spinning; otherwise they are not), this resolution left many people who mull over these issues unsatisfied. Beyond the intuitive sense that no perspective should be "more right" than any other, and beyond the eminently reasonable proposal of Leibniz that only relative motion between material objects has meaning, the concept of absolute space left many wondering how absolute space can allow us to identify true accelerated motion, as with the bucket, while it cannot pro- vide a way to identify true constant velocity motion. After all, if absolute space really exists, it should provide a benchmark for all motion, not just accelerated motion. If absolute space really exists, why doesn't it provide a way of identifying where we are located in an absolute sense, one that need not use our position relative to other material objects as a reference point? And, if absolute space really exists, how come it can affect us (causing our arms to splay if we spin, for example) while we apparently have no way to affect it?

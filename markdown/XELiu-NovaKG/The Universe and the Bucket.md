- It's not often that [a bucket of water]([[water bucket experiment]]) is [the central character in] [a three-hundred-year-long debate]. But a bucket that belonged to [Sir Isaac Newton] is [no ordinary bucket], and [a little experiment] he described in 1689 [has deeply influenced] some of [the world's greatest physicists] ever since. The experiment is this: Take a bucket filled with water, hang it by a rope, [twist the rope tightly] so that [it's ready to unwind], and let it go. At first, the bucket [starts to spin] but the water inside [remains fairly stationary]; the surface of the [stationary water] [stays nice and flat]. As the bucket [picks up speed], little by little its motion is [communicated to the water] by friction, and the water starts to spin too. As it does, the water's surface [takes on a concave shape](((_u-EvXS-0))), 水面呈凹形 higher at the rim and lower in the center, as in Figure 2.1.

    - That's the experiment—[not quite something that] [gets the heart racing]. 让人心跳加速 But [a little thought will show that] [this bucket of spinning water](((GKhwdZJBm))) is extremely puzzling. And coming to grips with it, as we [have not yet done] in over three centuries, [ranks among the most important steps toward] [grasping the structure of the universe](((fWPz22p8I))). Understanding why will [take some background], but it is well [worth the effort].
    - **Figure 2.1** [The surface of the water] [starts out flat] and remains so [as the bucket starts to spin]. Subsequently, as the water also starts to spin, its surface becomes concave, and it [remains concave] [while the water spins], even as the bucket [slows and stops].
- ## Relativity Before Einstein
    - "Relativity" is a word we [associate with Einstein], but the concept [goes much further back]. Galileo, Newton, and many others were [well aware that] [[velocity]] — [the speed and direction of an object's motion](((Ndc5Aj0zR))) —is relative. In modern terms, from the batter's point of view, [a well-pitched fastball] 一个投得好的快球 [might be approaching at] 100 miles per hour. From the baseball's [point of view], it's the batter who is approaching at 100 miles per hour. Both descriptions are accurate; it's just [a matter of perspective](((I09zrPaL2))). Motion has meaning only [in a relational sense]: [An object's velocity] [can be specified only in relation to] that of another object. You've probably experienced this. [When the train you are on] is next to another and you see [[relative motion]], [you can't immediately tell] which train is actually [moving on the tracks]. Galileo [described this effect] [using the transport of his day], boats. [Drop a coin] [on a smoothly sailing ship], Galileo said, and [it will hit your foot] [just as it would] [on dry land]. From your perspective, you are justified in declaring that you are stationary and it's the water that is rushing by the ship's hull. And since from this point of view you are not moving, the coin's motion relative to your foot will be exactly what it would have been before you embarked.

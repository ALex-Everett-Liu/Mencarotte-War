- __9th-level__ [abjuration](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_abjuration_Spells)
    - Casting time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
- A shimmering, 闪闪微光 multicolored plane of light forms [a vertical opaque wall]–up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick–[centered on a point] you can see within range. Alternatively, you can [shape the wall into a sphere] up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you [position the wall] so that it passes through [a space occupied by a creature], the spell fails, and your action and the [[spell slot]] are wasted.
    - The wall [sheds bright light out to a range of]([[bright light]]) 100 feet 流溢出亮光 and [[dim light]] for an additional 100 feet. You and [creatures you designate] at the time you [cast the spell](((minNJhrf2))) can pass through and [remain near the wall without harm]. If another creature that [can see the wall] moves to within 20 feet of it or [starts its turn there], the creature must succeed on a [[Constitution]] [[saving throw]] or [become blinded]([[blinded condition]]) for 1 minute.
    - The wall [consists of seven layers], each with a different color. When a creature attempts to [reach into or pass through the wall], it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a [[Dexterity]] saving throw or be affected by [that layer's properties] [as described below].
    - The wall can be destroyed, also [one layer at a time], in order [from red to violet], by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. [A](((ePL2jT_N-))) __rod of cancellation__ 消去之杖 destroys a __prismatic wall__, but an [[antimagic field]] [has no effect on it].

        - Similarly, antimagic field 防魔法力场 does not [hinder psionics]([[psionics]]), 阻碍灵能 nor does [null psionics field] [disrupt magic within its area]. provided by [[jukuu]]
        - **1. Red.** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
        - __**2. Orange.**__ The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.
        - __**3. Yellow.**__ The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.

    - Casting time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
- A shimmering, 闪闪微光 multicolored plane of light forms [a vertical opaque wall]–up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick–[centered on a point] you can see within range. Alternatively, you can [shape the wall into a sphere] up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you [position the wall] so that it passes through [a space occupied by a creature], the spell fails, and your action and the [[spell slot]] are wasted.
    - The wall [sheds bright light out to a range of]([[bright light]]) 100 feet 流溢出亮光 and [[dim light]] for an additional 100 feet. You and [creatures you designate] at the time you [cast the spell](((minNJhrf2))) can pass through and [remain near the wall without harm]. If another creature that [can see the wall] moves to within 20 feet of it or [starts its turn there], the creature must succeed on a [[Constitution]] [[saving throw]] or [become blinded]([[blinded condition]]) for 1 minute.
    - The wall [consists of seven layers], each with a different color. When a creature attempts to [reach into or pass through the wall], it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a [[Dexterity]] saving throw or be affected by [that layer's properties] [as described below].

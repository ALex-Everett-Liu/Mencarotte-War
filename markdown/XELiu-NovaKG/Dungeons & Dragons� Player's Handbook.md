- ## PREFACE
    - ONCE UPON A TIME, LONG, LONG AGO, IN A realm called the [Midwestern United States]-specifically the states of Minne­sota and Wisconsin-[a group of friends gathered together] to [forever alter the history of gaming].
        - It wasn't their intent to do so. They were tired of merely [reading tales about] [worlds of magic], monsters, and adventure. They wanted to [play in those worlds], rather than observe them. That they went on to invent DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and thereby [ignite a revolution] in gaming that [continues to this day], speaks to two things.
            - First, it speaks to their [ingenuity and genius] in fig­uring out that games were [the perfect way to] [explore worlds that could not otherwise exist]. Almost every modern game, whether played on a [[digital device]] or a [[tabletop]], **[owes some debt to] D&D.**
            - Second, [it is a testament to] the [inherent appeal] 内在吸引力 of [the game they created]. DUNGEONS & DRAGONS [sparked a thriving global phenomenon]. It is the first [roleplaying game]([[role-playing game (RPG)]]), and it [remains one of the best of] its breed.
    - Above all else, D&D is yours. [The friendships you make] [around the table] [will be unique to you]. The adven­tures you embark on, the characters you create, [the memories you make]-these will be yours. D&D is [your personal corner of the universe], a place where you [have free reign to do as you wish]. 自由支配
    - Go forth now. Read [the rules of the game](((CqBscZcPb))) and [the story of its worlds], but [always remember that] you are the one who [brings them to life]. They are nothing without [the spark of life] that you give them.

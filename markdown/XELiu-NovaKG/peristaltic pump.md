- A peristaltic pump, also commonly known as a [[roller pump]], is a type of [positive displacement pump](((H7m_Zbh-V))) used for [pumping a variety of fluids]. The fluid is contained in a [[flexible tube]] [fitted inside] a [circular pump casing]. 安装在圆形泵壳内 Most peristaltic pumps work through rotary motion, though linear peristaltic pumps have also been made. The rotor has a number of "wipers" or "rollers" attached to its external circumference, which compress the flexible tube as they rotate by. The part of the tube under compression is closed, forcing the fluid to move through the tube. Additionally, as the tube opens to its natural state after the rollers pass, more fluid is drawn into the tube. This process is called peristalsis and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, there will be two or more rollers compressing the tube, trapping a body of fluid between them. The body of fluid is transported through the tube, toward the pump outlet. Peristaltic pumps may run continuously, or they may be indexed through partial revolutions to deliver smaller amounts of fluid.
    - 蠕动泵 ，通常也称为滚子泵，是一种用于泵送各种流体的容积泵 。 流体包含在安装在圆形泵壳内的挠性管内（尽管已制成线性蠕动泵）。 甲转子具有连接到转子的外周上的多个“辊”，“鞋”，“雨刷”或“波瓣”压缩柔性管。 当转子转动时，受压的管子部分被挤压闭合（或“闭塞”），从而迫使要泵送的流体通过管子运动。 另外，由于[在凸轮通过之后][管子恢复到]其[自然状态]（“恢复”或“弹性”），所以流体流被引导至泵。 [这个过程被称为]蠕动 ，被用于许多生物系统，例如[胃肠道] 。 通常，将有两个或更多的辊子或刮水器[阻塞管子]，从而在它们之间[截留流体]。 然后，在环境压力下，流体[被输送到][泵的出口]。 蠕动泵[可以连续运行]，也可以通过部分转数进行分度，以输送更少量的流体。

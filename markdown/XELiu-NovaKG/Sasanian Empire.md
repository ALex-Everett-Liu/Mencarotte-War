- The Sasanian (/səˈsɑːniən, səˈseɪniən/) or Sassanid Empire, officially known as the Empire of Iranians (Middle Persian: 𐭠𐭩𐭥𐭠𐭭𐭱𐭲𐭥𐭩, Ērānšahr)[a] and also [referred to by historians as] the [[Neo-Persian Empire]],[9] was [the last Iranian empire] before the [[early Muslim conquests]] of [the 7th–8th centuries CE]. Named after [the House of Sasan]([[Sasanian dynasty]]), it endured for over four centuries, from 224 to 651 CE, making it [the longest-lived Persian imperial dynasty].[2][10] The Sasanian Empire succeeded the [[Parthian Empire]], and re-established the Persians as a [[major power]] in [[late antiquity]] [alongside its neighbouring arch-rival], 夙敌 the Roman Empire (after 395 the Byzantine Empire).[11][12][13]

    - [The empire was founded by] [[Ardashir I]], an Iranian ruler who rose to power as Parthia weakened from [internal strife] and [wars with the Romans]. After defeating the last Parthian shahanshah, Artabanus IV, at the Battle of Hormozdgan in 224, he established the Sasanian dynasty and set out to restore the legacy of the Achaemenid Empire by expanding Iran's dominions. At its greatest territorial extent, the Sasanian Empire encompassed all of present-day Iran and Iraq, and stretched from the eastern Mediterranean (including Anatolia and Egypt) to parts of modern-day Pakistan as well as from parts of southern Arabia to the Caucasus and Central Asia. According to legend, the vexilloid[b] of the Sasanian Empire was the Derafsh Kaviani.[14]
    - [The period of Sasanian rule] is [considered to be a high point in] [Iranian history][15] and in many ways was the peak of ancient [[Iranian culture]] [before the conquest by] [[Arab Muslim]]s ([[Muslim conquest]]) under the Rashidun Caliphate and subsequent Islamization of Iran. The Sasanians tolerated the varied faiths and cultures of their subjects, developed a complex and centralized government bureaucracy, and revitalized Zoroastrianism as a legitimizing and unifying force of their rule. They also built grand monuments, public works, and patronized cultural and educational institutions. The empire's [[cultural influence]] [extended far beyond] its [[territorial border]]s—including Western Europe,[16] Africa,[17] China, and India[18]—and helped shape European and Asian [[medieval art]].[19] [[Persian culture]] [became the basis for] much of [[Islamic culture]], influencing art, architecture, music, literature, and philosophy throughout the [[Muslim world]].[20]

- The Sasanian (/səˈsɑːniən, səˈseɪniən/) or Sassanid Empire, officially known as the Empire of Iranians (Middle Persian: 𐭠𐭩𐭥𐭠𐭭𐭱𐭲𐭥𐭩, Ērānšahr)[a] and also [referred to by historians as] the [[Neo-Persian Empire]],[9] was [the last Iranian empire] before the [[early Muslim conquests]] of [the 7th–8th centuries CE]. Named after [the House of Sasan]([[Sasanian dynasty]]), it endured for over four centuries, from 224 to 651 CE, making it [the longest-lived Persian imperial dynasty].[2][10] The Sasanian Empire succeeded the [[Parthian Empire]], and re-established the Persians as a [[major power]] in [[late antiquity]] [alongside its neighbouring arch-rival], 夙敌 the Roman Empire (after 395 the Byzantine Empire).[11][12][13](((b8yg3CL3P)))

    - [The empire was founded by] [[Ardashir I]], an [Iranian ruler] who [rose to power] as Parthia weakened from [internal strife] and [wars with the Romans]. After defeating the last Parthian [[shahanshah (king of kings)]], [[Artabanus IV]], at the [[Battle of Hormozdgan]] in 224, he established the [[Sasanian dynasty]] and set out to [restore the legacy of] the [[Achaemenid Empire]] by [expanding Iran's dominions]. 
        - At its greatest [[territorial extent]], the Sasanian Empire [encompassed all of present-day Iran and Iraq], and stretched from the [[eastern Mediterranean]] (including [[Anatolia]] and [[Egypt]]) to parts of [modern-day Pakistan] as well as from parts of [[southern Arabia]] to the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]]. According to legend, the vexilloid[b] 军旗 of the Sasanian Empire was the [[Derafsh Kaviani]].[14]

    - [The period of Sasanian rule] is [considered to be a high point in] [Iranian history][15] and in many ways was the peak of ancient [[Iranian culture]] [before the conquest by] [[Arab Muslim]]s ([[Muslim conquest]]) under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and subsequent [[Islamization of Iran]]. The Sasanians tolerated the [varied faiths and cultures] of their subjects, 容忍其臣民的不同信仰和文化 developed a complex and [[centralized government]] [[bureaucracy]], and revitalized [[Zoroastrianism]] 复兴 as a [legitimizing and unifying force] of their rule. 合法化 
        - They also built grand [[monument]]s, 宏伟的纪念碑 [[public work]]s, and patronized [cultural and educational institutions]. 赞助 The empire's [[cultural influence]] [extended far beyond] its [[territorial border]]s—including Western Europe,[16] Africa,[17] China, and India[18]—and helped shape European and Asian [[medieval art]].[19] [[Persian culture]] [became the basis for] much of [[Islamic culture]], influencing art, architecture, music, literature, and philosophy throughout the [[Muslim world]].[20]

    - サーサーン朝（サーサーンちょう, ペルシア語 : ساسانيان‎, Sāsāniyān‎, 英語 : Sassanid）は、イラン高原・[メソポタミア]などを支配した[王朝・帝国]（226年 - 651年）。首都は[クテシフォン]（現在のイラク）。ササン朝[ペルシア](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E6%9C%9D)とも呼ばれる。
        - サーサーン朝は、[数世紀前の][アケメネス朝]と同じくイラン高原[ファールス地方]から勃興した勢力で、その支配領域はエーラーン・シャフル（Ērān Šahr）と呼ばれ、おおよそアナトリア東部、アルメニアからアムダリア川西岸、アフガニスタンとトルクメニスタン、果てにウズベキスタン周辺まで及んだ。更に最大版図は現在のイランとイラクのすべてを包含し、地中海東岸（エジプトを含む）からパキスタンまで、そしてアラビア南部の一部からコーカサスと中央アジアまで広がっていた。
        - 特に始祖アルダフシール（アルダシール1世）自身が[ゾロアスター教]の[神官階層]から台頭したこともあり、[様々な変遷はあったものの](Although there were various transitions)ゾロアスター教と[強い結びつきを持った]帝国であった。 
        - サーサーン朝の支配の時代は[イランの歴史の最高点]と考えられており[1]、多くの点でイスラム教徒の征服とその後のイスラム化の前の[古代イラン文化の最盛期]であった。サーサーン朝は、多様な信仰と文化を容認し、[複雑で中央集権化された官僚制度]を発展させた。また帝国の支配の正当化と統一力としてゾロアスター教を活性化させ、壮大な記念碑や公共事業を建設し、文化的および教育的機関を優遇した。サーサーン朝の文化的影響力は、西ヨーロッパ[2]、アフリカ [3]、中国、インド[4]を含む領土の境界をはるかに超えて広がり、ヨーロッパとアジアの中世美術の形成に大きな影響を与えた[5]。ペルシャ文化はイスラム文化の多くの基礎となり、イスラム世界全体の芸術、建築、音楽、文学、哲学に影響を与えた[6]。

        - Like their predecessors the Parthians, the Sassanid Empire [carried out active foreign relations with] China, and [[ambassador]]s from Persia [frequently traveled to] China. [Chinese documents report on] sixteen [Sassanid embassies to China] from 455 to 555.[109](((brxxP7LcM))) Commercially, [[land trade]] and [[sea trade]] with China was important to both the Sassanid and Chinese Empires. Large numbers of [Sassanid coins] [have been found in southern China], confirming [[maritime trade]].

        - On different occasions, [Sassanid kings] sent their [most talented] [Persian musicians and dancers] to the Chinese [[imperial court]] at Luoyang [during the Jin and Northern Wei dynasties], and to Chang'an [during the Sui and Tang dynasties]. Both empires [benefited from trade along] the [[Silk Road]] and [shared a common interest in] [preserving and protecting that trade]. They cooperated in [guarding the trade routes] [through central Asia], and both built [[outpost]]s in [[border area]]s to [keep caravans safe from]([[caravan]]) [[nomadic tribe]]s and [[bandit]]s.

        - Politically, there is evidence of several Sassanid and Chinese efforts in forging alliances against the common enemy, the Hephthalites. Upon the rise of the nomadic Göktürks in Inner Asia, there is also what looks like a collaboration between China and the Sassanids to defuse Turkic advances. Documents from Mt. Mogh talk about the presence of a Chinese general in the service of the king of Sogdiana at the time of the Arab invasions.
        - Following the invasion of Iran by Muslim Arabs, Peroz III, son of Yazdegerd III, escaped along with a few Persian nobles and took refuge in the Chinese imperial court. Both Peroz and his son Narsieh (Chinese neh-shie) were given high titles at the Chinese court. On at least two occasions, the last possibly in 670, Chinese troops were sent with Peroz in order to restore him to the Sassanid throne with mixed results, one possibly ending in a short rule of Peroz in Sakastan, from which we have some remaining numismatic evidence. Narsieh later attained the position of a commander of the Chinese imperial guards, and his descendants lived in China as respected princes, Sassanian refugees fleeing from the Arab conquest to settle in China. The emperor of China at this time was Gaozong of Tang.

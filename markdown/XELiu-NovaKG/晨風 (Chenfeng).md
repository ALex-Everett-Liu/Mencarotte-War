- 鴥彼晨風、鬱彼北林。
未見君子、憂心欽欽。
如何如何、忘我實多。 #pt8-100
    - 晨风：鸟名，即鹯鸟（zhān），属于[鹞鹰]一类的[猛禽]。鴥：鸟疾飞的样子。
    - 钦钦：忧思难忘的样子。朱熹《诗集传》：“忧而不忘之貌。”
    - Swiftly sped the sparrow-hawk,
Northward [where the woods grow dense].—
Absent is my husband still,
And ’tis sad, this long suspense.
Why is he, methinks, and how
So unmindful of me now?
    - Swift flies the falcon,
To the thick-wooded forest in the north.
While I do not see my husband,
My heart cannot forget its grief.
How is it, how is it,
That he forgets me so very much?
- 山有苞棣、隰有樹檖。
未見君子、憂心如醉。
如何如何、忘我實多。
    - 棣：唐棣，也叫郁李，果实[色红]，如梨。
    - 形容檖树直立的样子。檖：山梨。
    - On the hill wild cherry-trees,
[On the meadowland] [wild pears].—
With my husband absent still
I seem stupefied with cares. 忧心忡忡
Why is he, methinks, and how
So unmindful of me now?
    - On the mountain are the bushy sparrow-plums;
[In the low wet grounds] are [the high, wild pear trees].
While I do not see my husband,
[My heart is as if] [intoxicated with grief].
How is it, how is it,
That he forgets me so very much?
- 《毛诗序》持“刺[秦康公][弃其贤臣]说”，朱谋玮《诗故》持“刺[弃三良]说”，何楷《诗经[世本][古义]》“秦穆公[悔过]说”。朱熹《诗集传》说此诗写妇女担心[外出的丈夫][已将她遗忘和抛弃]。

- A buck converter ([[step-down converter]]) is a [[DC-to-DC power converter]] which steps down voltage (while drawing less [[average current]]) from its input ([[supply]]) to its output ([[load]]). [It is a class of] [[switched-mode power supply (SMPS)]] [typically containing at least] two [[semiconductor]]s (a [[diode]] and a [[transistor]], although [modern buck converters] frequently replace the diode [with a second transistor] used for [[synchronous rectification]]) and at least one [energy storage element](((1Zp-anqkQ))), a [[capacitor]], [[inductor]], 电感应器 or [the two in combination]. 
    - To reduce [[voltage ripple]], [[filter]]s made of capacitors ([sometimes in combination with] inductors) are normally added to [such a converter's] output ([[load-side filter]]) and input ([[supply-side filter]]).[1] It is called a buck converter because [the voltage across the inductor “bucks”] or opposes the [[supply voltage]].[2]

    - [[switching converter]]s (such as buck converters) provide much greater [[power efficiency]] as [[DC-to-DC converter]]s than [[linear regulator]]s, which are [simpler circuits] that [lower voltages] by [dissipating power as heat](((60uEen3Dz))), but do not step up [[output current]].[3]
(通过将电源能量以热能型式耗散，而非逐步增加输出电流的方式来降低电压，这样做使得电路更简单，且直流间降压转换的电源效率比线性稳压/降压更高) #pt9-99.99

    - The efficiency of buck converters can be very high, often over 90%, making them useful for tasks such as converting a computer's main supply voltage, which is usually 12 V, down to lower voltages needed by USB, DRAM and the CPU, which are usually 5, 3.3 or 1.8 V.

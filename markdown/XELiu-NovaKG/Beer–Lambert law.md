- The Beer–Lambert law, also known as Beer's law, the Lambert–Beer law, or the [Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law] relates [the attenuation of light]([[light attenuation]]) [to the properties of the material] [through which the light is travelling]. The law is [commonly applied to] [[chemical analysis]] measurements and used in understanding [[light attenuation]] in [[physical optics]], for photons, neutrons, or [[rarefied gas]]es. 稀薄气体 In [[mathematical physics]], this law [arises as a solution of] the [[BGK equation]].
    - [A demonstration of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beer%E2%80%93Lambert_law_in_solution.JPG) the Beer–Lambert law: [green laser light] in a solution of Rhodamine 6B. The [beam radiant power] becomes weaker [as it passes through solution].
- Chemical analysis by [[spectrophotometry]]
    - The Beer–Lambert law [can be applied to] [the analysis of a mixture]([[mixture]]) by spectrophotometry, [without the need for] [extensive pre-processing of the sample]. An example is the determination of [[bilirubin]] in [[blood plasma]] samples. 血浆样品中胆红素的测定 The spectrum of pure bilirubin is known, so the [[molar attenuation coefficient]] ε is known. Measurements of [[decadic attenuation coefficient]] μ10 are [made at one wavelength λ] that is nearly unique for bilirubin and [at a second wavelength] in order to [correct for possible interferences]. The [[amount concentration]] c is then given by $$c={\frac  {\mu_{10} (\lambda )}{\varepsilon (\lambda )}}.$$
    - The law is [used widely in] [[infra-red spectroscopy]] and [[near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)]] for analysis of [polymer degradation and oxidation] (also in [[biological tissue]]) as well as to measure the concentration of various compounds in different [food samples]. The carbonyl group attenuation at about 6 micrometres [can be detected quite easily], and degree of oxidation of the polymer calculated.

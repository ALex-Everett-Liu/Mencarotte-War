- The state of Jin (Korean pronunciation: [tɕin]) was a [[confederacy]] of [[statelet]]s which [occupied some portion of] [the southern Korean peninsula] during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE, bordering the Korean kingdom [[Gojoseon (古朝鮮)]] to the north. Its capital was [somewhere south of] the [[汉江 (Han River)]]. It preceded the [Samhan confederacies]([[三韩 (Samhan)]]), each of which [claimed to be successors of] the Jin state.[1]

- Name
    - "Jin" is the [[Revised Romanization of Korean]] 진, [originally written] 辰 in [Korean Chinese characters] ([[hanja]]). This character's [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation has been reconstructed as /*[d]ər/[2] and [originally referred to] the 5th [earthly branch] of the [Chinese and Korean zodiacs]([[Chinese zodiac]]), a division of [the orbit of Jupiter](((XHJzChYJL))) [identified with the dragon]. This was [associated with a bearing of] 120° (between ESE and SE) but also with the [two-hour period] between 7 and 9 am, leading it to be associated with [[dawn]] and [the direction east].

- A beam splitter is an [[optical device]] that [splits a beam of light in two]. It is a [crucial part] of many [optical experimental and measurement systems], such as [[interferometer]]s, also [finding widespread application in] [[fibre optic telecommunication]]s.
- Beam-splitter designs
    - In its most common form, a cube, a beam splitter is made from two triangular [[glass prism]]s which are [glued together at their base] using polyester, epoxy, or urethane-based [[adhesive]]s. 聚酯、环氧树脂或[氨基甲酸乙酯基]粘合剂 (Before these [[synthetic resin]]s, [natural ones] were used, e.g. [[Canada balsam]].) [The thickness of the resin layer is adjusted] such that (for a certain wavelength) [half of the light] [incident through one "port"] (i.e., face of the cube) is reflected and [the other half is transmitted] due to [[FTIR (Frustrated Total Internal Reflection)]]. [[polarizing beam splitter]]s, such as the [[Wollaston prism]], use [[birefringent material]]s to [split light into two beams of] [orthogonal polarization states].

    - [Another design] is the use of a [[half-silvered mirror]]. This is composed of an [[optical substrate]], which is often [a sheet of glass or plastic], with a [partially transparent] [thin coating of metal]. The [thin coating] can be aluminium [deposited from aluminium vapor] using a [[physical vapor deposition]] method. [The thickness of the deposit is controlled]([[deposit]]) so that part (typically half) of the light, which is [incident at a 45-degree angle] and not [absorbed by the coating or substrate material], is transmitted and [the remainder is reflected]. 
        - [A very thin half-silvered mirror] used in [[photography]] is often called a [[pellicle mirror]]. [To reduce loss of light due to] absorption by the [[reflective coating]], so-called ["Swiss-cheese" beam-splitter mirrors] have been used. Originally, these were [sheets of highly polished metal] [perforated with holes] to [obtain the desired ratio of reflection to transmission]. Later, [metal was sputtered onto glass] so as to [form a discontinuous coating], or small areas of a [continuous coating] were [removed by chemical or mechanical action] to [produce a very literally "half-silvered" surface]. 产生一个真正的

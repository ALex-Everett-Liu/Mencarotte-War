- The Tocharians, or Tokharians (US: /toʊˈkɛəriən/ or /toʊˈkɑːriən/;[5] UK: /tɒˈkɑːriən/),[6] were speakers of [[Tocharian languages]], [[Indo-European languages]] known from around 7600 documents [from around 400 to 1200 AD], [found on the northern edge of] the Tarim Basin (modern [[新疆 (Xinjiang)]], China).[7] The name "Tocharian" was [given to these languages] [in the early 20th century] by scholars who [identified their speakers with] a people known [in ancient Greek sources] as the Tókharoi (Latin Tochari), who [inhabited Bactria] [from the 2nd century BC]. This identification is [generally considered erroneous], but the name "Tocharian" [remains the most common term for] the languages and their speakers. Their [actual ethnic name] is unknown, although they may have [referred to themselves as] Agni, Kuči and Krorän, or Agniya, Kuchiya as known [from Sanskrit texts]([[Sanskrit]]).[8]

    - [Agricultural communities] first appeared [in the oases of the northern Tarim] [circa 2000 BC]. Some scholars have linked these communities to the [[Afanasievo culture]] found earlier (c. 3500–2500 BC) in Siberia, north of the Tarim or Central Asian [[BMAC culture]]. The earliest [Tarim mummies], which [may not be connected to] the Tocharians, date from c. 1800 BC.
    - By the 2nd century BC, these [[settlement]]s [had developed into] [[city-state]]s, overshadowed by [[nomadic people]]s to the north and [Chinese empires] to the east. These cities, the largest of which was [[库车 (Kucha)]], also served as [way stations] 中途站 [on the branch of] the [[Silk Road]] that [ran along the northern edge of] the [[Taklamakan desert]].

    - [For several centuries] the Tarim basin was ruled by the Xiongnu, Han Dynasty, [Tibetan Empire] and [Tang Dynasty]. From the 8th century AD, the [[Uyghur]]s – speakers of a [[Turkic language]] – [settled in the region] and founded the [[高昌回鶻 (Qocho Uyghurs)]]/[Kingdom of Qocho] that [ruled Tarim Basin]. The peoples of the [Tarim city-states] [intermixed with the Uyghurs], whose [[Old Uyghur language]] [spread through the region]. The Tocharian languages are [believed to have become extinct] [during the 9th century].

- In the [[mathematically rigorous]] formulation of quantum mechanics developed by Paul Dirac,[27] David Hilbert,[28] John von Neumann,[29] and [[Hermann Weyl]],[30] the [[possible state]]s of a [quantum mechanical system] are [[symbolized]][31] as [[unit vector]]s (called [[state vector]]s) $$\displaystyle \psi$$. Formally, these vectors are elements of a complex [separable]([[separable space]]) [[Hilbert space]] {$$\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}$$} – variously called the [[state space]] or the [[associated Hilbert space]] of the system – that is [well defined] up to a [[complex number]] of [[norm]] 1 (the [[phase factor]]). In other words, the possible states are points in the [[projective space]] of a Hilbert space, usually called the [[complex projective space]]. The [exact nature] of this Hilbert space is [[dependent on the system]] – for example, the state space for [[position]] and [[momentum]] states is the space of [[square-integrable function]]s $$\displaystyle L^{2}(\mathbb {C} )$$, while the state space for the [[spin]] of a single [[proton]] is just the [[product]] of two [[complex plane]]s. #mathcal #mathbb

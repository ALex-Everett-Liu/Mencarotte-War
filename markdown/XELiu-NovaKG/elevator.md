- An elevator or [[lift]] is a type of cable-assisted, 电缆辅助 hydraulic cylinder-assisted, 液压缸 or [roller-track assisted machine] 滚轮轨道 that [vertically transports people or freight between] floors, levels, or decks 甲板 of a building, vessel, or other structure. They are typically powered by [[electric motor]]s that drive [[traction cable]]s and [[counterweight system]]s such as a [[hoist]], although some [pump hydraulic fluid] to raise a [[cylindrical piston]] like a [[jack]].

    - In agriculture and manufacturing, an elevator is any type of [[conveyor device]] used to [lift materials in a continuous stream into] 将材料连续提升至 [bins or silos]. Several types exist, such as [the chain and bucket elevator], 链式和斗式提升机 [grain auger screw conveyor] 谷物螺旋输送机 using the principle of [[Archimedes' screw]], or [the chain and paddles or forks] 桨叶或叉子 of [hay elevators]. 干草升降机 Languages other than English, such as Japanese, may refer to elevators by [[loanword]]s based on either elevator or lift. Due to [[wheelchair access law]]s, elevators are often a [legal requirement] in new [[multistory building]]s, especially where [[wheelchair ramp]]s are not possible.

    - [Some elevators can also] [travel horizontally] in addition to the usual [vertical motion].[1]
- ## History
    - ### Pre-industrial era
        - [The earliest known reference to] an elevator is in the works of the [Roman architect] Vitruvius, who reported that [[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BC – c. 212 BC) built his first elevator probably in 236 BC.[2] [Sources from later periods mention] elevators as [cabs on a hemp rope], 麻绳上的轿厢 powered by people or animals.
        - The Roman [[Colosseum]], completed in AD 80, had roughly 25 elevators that were used for [raising animals up to the floor]. [Each elevator could carry] about 600 pounds (270 kg) (roughly the weight of two lions) 23 feet (7.0 m) up [when powered by up to eight men].[3]
        - In 1000, the [Book of Secrets] by [Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi] in [Islamic Spain] described the use of [an elevator-like lifting device] to [raise a large battering ram]([[battering ram]]) to [destroy a fortress].[4]
        - In the 17th century, [prototypes of elevators] were installed in the [palace buildings] of England and France. [Louis XV of France] had a so-called 'flying chair' built for one of his [[mistress]]es at the [Chateau de Versailles] in 1743.[5]

        - Ancient and medieval elevators used drive systems based on hoists and windlasses. The invention of a system based on the screw drive was perhaps the most important step in elevator technology since ancient times, leading to the creation of modern passenger elevators. The first screw-drive elevator was built by Ivan Kulibin and installed in the Winter Palace in 1793, although there may have been an earlier design by Leonardo da Vinci.[6] Several years later another of Kulibin's elevators was installed in the Arkhangelskoye near Moscow.

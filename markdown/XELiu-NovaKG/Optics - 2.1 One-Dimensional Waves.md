- [An essential aspect of] a [[traveling wave]] is that it is a self-sustaining disturbance of the medium [through which it propagates]. The most familiar waves, and the easiest to visualize (Fig. 2.1), are the [[mechanical wave]]s, among which are [waves on strings], [[surface wave]]s on liquids, [[sound wave]]s in the air, and [[compression wave]]s in both solids and fluids. Sound waves are [[longitudinal wave]]—the medium is displaced [in the direction of] [motion of the wave]. [Waves on a string]([[string wave]]) (and electromagnetic waves) are [[transverse wave]]—the medium is displaced [in a direction perpendicular to] that of the motion of the wave. 
    - In all cases, although the [energy-carrying disturbance](((HBpqu-Km3))) [advances through the medium], the [individual participating atoms] [remain in the vicinity of] their [[equilibrium position]]s: the disturbance advances, not the [[material medium]]. That’s one of several [crucial features] of a wave that [distinguishes it from] [a stream of particles](((vlAOlUCjf))). [The wind blowing across a field] sets up “waves of grain” that sweep by, (风吹过田野，掀起了一阵阵的“谷浪”。) even though each stalk only [sways in place]. 每根茎只在原地摆动 [[Leonardo da Vinci]] seems to [have been the first person to recognize that] a wave [does not transport the medium] through which it travels, and it is precisely this property that allows waves to [propagate at very great speeds].
(尽管携带能量的扰动行进通过整个介质中，每一个振动位移的原子个体仍保持在其平衡位置的边缘。即，行进的是扰动而非材料介质本身。这也是波动区别于粒子流的决定性特征之一。也正是因为这一点，波的传播速度能够很快，超过媒介与环境本身的限制)

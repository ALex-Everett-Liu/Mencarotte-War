    - ### Rest

    - ### Unmeasurable
        - [Unmeasured periods](((g2NaMPZAn))) are typically when [high-resolution heart rate data](((stZ5d9jI1))) is unavailable. For example, recovery from exercise, short awakenings during sleep, times when you are [moving your hands a lot] or [missing data periods]—such as [during a shower].

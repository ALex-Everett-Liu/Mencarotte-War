- A [proportional–integral–derivative controller] (PID controller or [three-term controller]) 三项 is a [[control loop]] mechanism employing [[feedback]] that is widely used in [[industrial control system (ICS)]]s and [a variety of other applications] requiring [continuously modulated control](((vu6SV1d_4))). A PID controller [continuously calculates] an [[error value]] $${\displaystyle e(t)}$$ [as the difference between] a [[desired setpoint (SP)]] and a measured [[process variable (PV)]] and [applies a correction]([[correction]]) based on [[proportional control]], integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.

    - In practical terms, PID automatically [applies an accurate and responsive correction to] a [[control function]]. [An everyday example] is the [[cruise control]] on a car, where [ascending a hill] would [lower speed] if constant [[engine power]] were applied. The controller's [[PID algorithm]] restores the [measured speed] to the [desired speed] with [[minimal delay]] and [[overshoot]] 过冲/过调 by [increasing the power output of the engine] [in a controlled manner].
    - The first theoretical analysis and practical application of PID was in the field of [automatic steering systems](((i1qJKshN1))) for ships, developed from the early 1920s onwards. [It was then used for] [automatic process control](((TXq1m5ROh))) in the [[manufacturing industry]], where it was widely implemented in at first pneumatic and then electronic controllers. Today the PID concept is used universally in applications requiring accurate and optimized automatic control.

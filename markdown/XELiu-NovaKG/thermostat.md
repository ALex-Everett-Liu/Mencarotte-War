- A thermostat is a [regulating device component] which senses the [[temperature]] of a [[physical system]] and [performs actions] so that the [system's temperature] is [maintained near a desired setpoint]([[setpoint]]).
    - Thermostats are [used in any device or system that] [heats or cools to a setpoint temperature], examples include [[building heating]], 建筑供暖 [[central heating]], [[air conditioner]]s, [[HVAC system]]s, [[water heater]]s, 热水器 as well as [kitchen equipment] including [[oven]]s and [[refrigerator]]s and [medical and scientific incubators]. 恒温箱 孵卵器 培养器 In scientific literature, these devices are often [broadly classified as] [[thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs)]]. 恒温控制负载 Thermostatically controlled loads comprise roughly 50% of the overall electricity demand in the United States.[1]
    - A thermostat operates as a "closed loop" control device, as it seeks to reduce the error between the desired and measured temperatures. Sometimes a thermostat combines both the sensing and control action elements of a controlled system, such as in an automotive thermostat.
    - The word thermostat is derived from the Greek words θερμός thermos, "hot" and στατός statos, "standing, stationary".

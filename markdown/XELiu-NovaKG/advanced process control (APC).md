- In control theory, Advanced process control (APC) [refers to a broad range of] [techniques and technologies implemented within] [industrial process control systems](((DM9oh56U1))). Advanced process controls are [usually deployed optionally] and in addition to [basic process controls]. Basic process controls are [designed and built with the process itself], to facilitate basic operation, control and automation requirements. 便于基本操作 Advanced process controls are typically [added subsequently], often over the course of many years, to [address particular performance] or [economic improvement opportunities] in the process.
    - Process control (basic and advanced) normally implies the [process industries], which includes chemicals, petrochemicals, oil and mineral refining, food processing, pharmaceuticals, [[power generation]], etc. These industries are characterized by [[continuous process]]es and [[fluid processing]], as opposed to [discrete parts manufacturing], such as automobile and [electronics manufacturing]. The term [[process automation]] is [essentially synonymous with] process control.
    - Process controls (basic as well as advanced) are implemented within the [[process control system]], which may mean a [[distributed control system (DCS)]], [[programmable logic controller (PLC)]], and/or a [[supervisory control computer]]. DCSs and PLCs are typically [industrially hardened](((onUA0jl-f))) and [fault-tolerant](((Iq1i0yyVk))). 工业强化 Supervisory control computers are often [not hardened or fault-tolerant], but they [bring a higher level of] [computational capability] to the control system, to host valuable, but not critical, advanced control applications. Advanced controls [may reside in either] the DCS or the supervisory computer, depending on the application. Basic controls [reside in the DCS] and its subsystems, including PLCs.

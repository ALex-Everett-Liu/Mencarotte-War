- [We briefly explain](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/infrared-and-raman/ft-ir-microscopes/what-is-ft-ir-microscopy.html) the fundamentals of [infrared (IR) microscopy](((mOqr7WGPC))) and [focus on the basic questions about] detectors, mapping and [FT-IR imaging].
- ## GETTING STARTED
    - ### What is Infrared Microscopy or µ-FT-IR? Is there a difference?
        - **About infrared (IR) microscopy**
            - [Infrared or FT-IR microscopy] is [the exciting combination of] conventional [light microscopy](((solSAYLoO))) and a unique [chemical identification] by [FT-IR spectroscopy](((bvYzKKB0i))).
            - Individually, both techniques are already quite powerful, but together they [offer the possibility to] [examine smallest objects chemically], combining [spectral characterization] with [[spatial resolution]].
            - That being said, there are some technological hurdles, as the usual optical microscopy use glass lenses, will will not allow IR light to pass freely, which is needed to analyze samples by infrared spectroscopy.
            - Thus, special lenses using IR transparent materials or cassegrain objectives must be used.
        - **About sampling in FT-IR microscopy**
            - Typical examples of the application of µ-FT-IR are particles and smallest product damages, coatings on metal surfaces, single crystal studies and much more.
            - In general, the same methods can be used in IR microscopy as for macroscopic samples, i.e. transmission, reflection and ATR.
            - However, for measurements in  transmission or transflection the samples must be very thin (<15 µm) or be available as KBr pellets, which can be quite a challenge during sample preparation.
            - As in spectroscopy, ATR offers decisive advantages in microscopy, which have made this non-destructive analysis method the standard.
        - **About ATR in microscopy**
            - ATR stands for attenuated total reflectance and is applied by pressing a crystal with a very fine tip on the sample. The Infared light is passing the crystal and interacts with the sample beneath it, yielding an IR spectra.
            - It should be noted, that ATR produces high quality
            - FT-IR data of almost any sample type without prior preparation. Furthermore, it also gives you the edge when it comes to spatial resolution.
            - The germanium crystal acts as a solid immersion lens, improving spatial resolution by factor 4, when compared to transmission and reflection measurements. This way, you easily analyze samples as small as a few microns.
- ## GETTING INTO DETAILS
    - ### About Detectors in FT-IR microscopy
        - [Above we described the basics of] how µ-IR is used as a "point-and-shoot" method and this is the [common approach for] [simple applications] or [research studies]. As you can imagine, the smaller [certain particles] are, [the harder it is to obtain] a nice [[infrared spectrum]].
            - This is exactly, why [high-sensitivity detectors](((wEJ6032PL))) are [used for these kind of applications]. Among those you there are so-called single-element and [imaging detectors]. As this page deals with microscopy, we will focus on [single-element detectors](((ksDtfjXch))), hence: DLaTGS, TE-MCT and LN-MCT.
        - You want [more basic information](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/infrared-and-raman/ft-nir-spectrometers/what-is-ft-nir-spectroscopy.html) on FT-IR spectroscopy?
        - Comparative Analysis of different [IR detectors]([[infrared detector]]). TE-MCT and LN-MCT [show an almost identical] [[signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]] at 30 µm [[aperture]] and 1 min [measurement time].

        - [Deuterated Lanthanum α Alanine doped TriGlycine Sulphate (DLaTGS)] 氘化镧 丙氨酸 掺杂 硫酸三甘氨酸 detectors [exhibit the most effective] [[pyroelectric effect]] known and are [versatile detectors] that don't need [external cooling](((yDtYTzWID))) to [produce high quality spectra]. However, as soon as the [[aperture]] (and samples) [gets smaller] and [less and less light reaches the detector] the [spectra's quality] [quickly diminishes].
        - Below 50 µm, [it is best to chose] a [cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector], 碲镉汞 that [offers increased sensitivity] [on low-light scenarios]. Using a [thermoelectrically cooled MCT] [has become the standard solution] as it is [continuously cooled] and [doesn't require maintenance].
        - But still, for the [smallest samples] below 10 µm in size, [liquid nitrogen cooled MCTs (LN-MCTs)] are the [best option] but, of course [need some time to cooldown] and/or may need [refilling with liquid nitrogen] [during prolonged use]. 
        - What is still missing is the last but most powerful way to do FT-IR microscopy:
**Focal-Plane-Array (FPA) imaging.**

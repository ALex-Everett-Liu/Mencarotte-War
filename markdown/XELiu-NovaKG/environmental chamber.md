- An environmental chamber, also called a climatic chamber or climate chamber, is an enclosure used to test the effects of specified environmental conditions on biological items, industrial products, materials, and electronic devices and components.
    - Such a chamber can be used:
        - as a stand-alone test for environmental effects on test specimens
        - as preparation of test specimens for further physical tests or chemical tests
        - as environmental conditions for conducting testing of specimens
- ## Constant Climate Chambers
    - ### The perfect climate for any application
        - BINDER climate chambers stand out when testing material behaviors under constant temperature and humidity conditions. They are fully compliant with ICH guidelines and offer the best solution for stability testing of active pharmaceutical ingredients at 40 °C and 75% RH as well as for numerous other applications.
        - Series KBF P and KBF LQC climate chambers also offer ICH-compliant illumination for standard-compliant long-term tests. In combination with the innovative Light Quantum Control (LQC), they offer a reliable all-in-one solution for photostability testing in a single chamber. Wide temperature and humidity ranges can be realized with Series KMF chambers – ideal for complex stress tests at 85 °C and 85% RH, for example.

- Ever wondered how [computer programming] works, but [haven't done anything more complicated] [on the web] than [upload a photo to Facebook]?
    - Then you're in the right place.
    - To someone who's [never coded before], the concept of [creating a website from scratch] -- layout, [design]([[Web Design]]), and all -- can seem really intimidating. You might be picturing [Harvard students] from the movie, __The Social Network__, [sitting at their computers] [with gigantic headphones on] and [hammering out code], and think to yourself, 'I could never do that.'

        - Actually, you can.
        - Anyone can learn to code, just like anyone can [learn a new language]. In fact, programming is kind of like [speaking a foreign language] -- [which is exactly why] they're called programming __languages____.__ Each one has its own [rules and syntax] that [need to be learned step by step]. Those rules are ways to [tell your computer what to do]. More specifically, in [web programming], they're ways of telling your __browsers__ what to do. #browser
        - [The goal of this post] is to, in plain English, teach you with the basics of HTML, CSS, and [one of the most common programming languages], JavaScript. But before we begin, let's [get an idea of] what programming languages actually are.
- ## What Is a Programming Language?
    - Programming, or coding, is like [solving a puzzle]. Consider a [human language], like English or French. We [use these languages to] [turn thoughts and ideas into] [actions and behavior]. In programming, [the goal of the puzzle] is [exactly the same] -- you're just [driving different kinds of behavior]([[drive the behavior]]), and [the source of that behavior] isn't a human. It's a computer.

    - A programming language is our way of [communicating with software]. The people who use programming languages are [often called programmers or developers]. The things we tell software using a programming language could be to [make a webpage] [look a certain way], or to make [an object on the page] move if the [human user] [takes a certain action].
    - ### Programming in [[Web Development]]
        - So, when a [web designer] is [given an end goal] like "create a webpage that has this [[header]], this font, these colors, these pictures, and [an animated unicorn] [walking across the screen] [when users click on this button]," the web designer's job is to [take that big idea] and [break it apart into tiny pieces], and then [translate these pieces into instructions] that [the computer can understand] -- including [putting all these instructions in the correct order] or syntax.
            - [Every page on the web that you visit] is built using [a sequence of separate instructions], one after another. Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and so on) is [a big actor] in [translating code into] [something we can see on our screens] and [even interact with]. [It can be easy to forget] that [code without a browser] is just a [[text file]] -- it's when you [put that text file into] a __browser__ [that the magic happens]. When you [open a web page], your browser fetches the HTML and [other programming languages involved] and interprets it.

            - HTML and CSS are actually [not technically programming languages]; they're just [[page structure]] and [style information]. But before moving on to JavaScript and other true languages, [you need to know] [the basics of HTML and CSS], as they are on the [[front end]] of [every web page and application].
                - In the very early 1990s, HTML was the only language [available on the web]. [Web developers] had to painstakingly code [[static site]]s, page by page. A lot's changed since then: Now there are many computer programming languages available.
                - In this post, I'll talk about HTML, CSS, and one of the most common programming languages: JavaScript.
- ## HTML, CSS, & JavaScript: A Tutorial
    - An overview:
        - HTML provides the __basic structure__ of sites, which is [enhanced and modified by other technologies] like CSS and JavaScript. #[[basic structure]]
        - CSS is used to control __presentation, formatting, and layout__. #presentation #formatting #layout
        - JavaScript is used to control the __behavior__ of [different elements]([[the behavior of elements]]).
    - Now, let's [go over each one individually] to [help you understand] [the roles each plays] on a website and then we'll cover [how they fit together]. Let's start with good ol' HTML.
    - ### HTML
        - HTML is [at the core of] every web page, regardless [the complexity of a site] or [number of technologies involved]. It's [an essential skill] for any [web professional]. It's the [starting point] for anyone learning how to [create content for the web]. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn.
        - ### How does HTML work?
            - HTML stands for [[HyperText Markup Language (HTML)]]. "[[Markup language]]" means that, rather than using a programming language to [perform functions], HTML uses [[tag]]s to [identify different types of content] and [the purposes they each serve to the webpage].

        - Let me show you [what I mean]. Take a look at the article below. If I were to ask you to [[label]] [[the types of content]] on the page, you'd probably [do pretty well]: There's the header at the top, then a [[subheader]] below it, the [[body text]], and [some images at the bottom] [followed by a few more bits of text].

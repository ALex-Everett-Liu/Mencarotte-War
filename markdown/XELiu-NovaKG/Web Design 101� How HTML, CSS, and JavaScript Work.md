- Ever wondered how [computer programming] works, but [haven't done anything more complicated] [on the web] than [upload a photo to Facebook]?
    - Then you're in the right place.
    - To someone who's [never coded before], the concept of [creating a website from scratch] -- [[layout]], [design]([[Web Design]]), and all -- can seem really intimidating. You might be picturing [Harvard students] from the movie, __The Social Network__, [sitting at their computers] [with gigantic headphones on] and [hammering out code], and think to yourself, 'I could never do that.'

        - Actually, you can.
        - Anyone can learn to code, just like anyone can [learn a new language]. In fact, programming is kind of like [speaking a foreign language] -- [which is exactly why] they're called programming __languages____.__ Each one has its own [rules and syntax] that [need to be learned step by step]. Those rules are ways to [tell your computer what to do]. More specifically, in [web programming], they're ways of telling your __browsers__ what to do. #browser
        - [The goal of this post] is to, in plain English, teach you with the basics of HTML, CSS, and [one of the most common programming languages], JavaScript. But before we begin, let's [get an idea of] what programming languages actually are.
- ## What Is a Programming Language?
    - Programming, or coding, is like [solving a puzzle]. Consider a [human language], like English or French. We [use these languages to] [turn thoughts and ideas into] [actions and behavior]. In programming, [the goal of the puzzle] is [exactly the same] -- you're just [driving different kinds of behavior]([[drive the behavior]]), and [the source of that behavior] isn't a human. It's a computer.

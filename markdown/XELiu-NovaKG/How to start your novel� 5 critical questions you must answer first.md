- [Writing a novel]([[novel]]) is [the most amazing adventure] [you may ever undertake]. It's [a baring of the soul], no matter how fictional. It requires dedication, attention to detail, imagination, and [a burning desire to] [tell a story]. When you sit down to [begin your story outline](((zWMEM_Uq_))), you're [taking the first step on] [a journey into the unknown]. Fortunately, many [[novelist]]s [have already travelled the path before you], so you don't have to [go into that wilderness without a map].

- ### What is this novel about?
    - The first question is "What is this novel about?" [At this stage], you don't want to [dive too deep]. [State your answer as] a ["What if…" question], and [limit yourself to twenty words] or less. These limitations help to [refine your concept](((UKI1gPxTv))). See example below for [The Wizard of Oz].
- ### What are the stakes?
    - The next question is "What are the stakes?" If your heroes fail, what will happen? What do the world and your characters have to lose [if this story ends in tragedy]?
- ### What is the core conflict?
    - After the stakes, you want to define the [[core conflict]]. [A great way to express this] is with an ["X versus Y" statement], where X is your [[protagonist]] and Y is [the force working against your protagonist], who or what wants to [keep the protagonist from achieving success]? Is it an individual, a group, a situation, an [internal struggle], or something else? Again, see our example below from The Wizard of Oz.

- Vim (/vɪm/;[2](((ULTmBQ4Sk))) a contraction of Vi IMproved) is a clone, with additions, of Bill Joy's [vi text editor program] for Unix. Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, [based it on the source code] for a port of the Stevie editor to the Amiga[3](((Y-f7W6FxD))) and [released a version to the public] in 1991. Vim is [designed for use] both from a [[command-line interface]] and [as a standalone application] in a [[graphical user interface (GUI)]]. Vim is [free and open-source software](((bzCWaTAnR))) and is [released under a license that] includes some [charityware clauses], 慈善软件条款 encouraging [users who enjoy the software] to consider [donating to children in Uganda].[4] The license is compatible with the GNU [[General Public License (GPL)]] [through a special clause] [allowing distribution of modified copies](((E3vKXkDJ4))) "under the [GNU GPL version 2] [or any later version]".[5]

    - Since its release for the Amiga, [cross-platform development](((hp1--zq9P))) has [made it available on many other systems].

- Interface
    - Like vi, Vim's interface is not based on [[menu]]s or [[icon]]s but on [commands given in a text user interface]; its [GUI mode], gVim, adds menus and [[toolbar]]s for [commonly used commands] but the [full functionality](((rOCidNBG5))) is still expressed through its [command line mode]. Vi (and by extension Vim) tends to [allow a typist to]([[typist]]) [keep their fingers on the home row], 放在第一排 which [can be an advantage for] a [touch typist]([[touch typing]]).[29](((X8FHXPxIu)))

    - Vim has a [built-in tutorial for beginners] called vimtutor. It's usually [installed along with Vim], but it [exists as a separate executable](((6W__iL4cI))) and [can be run with a shell command]([[shell command]]).[30] There is also the Vim [Users' Manual]([[user manual]]) that [details Vim's features] and a [[FAQ]]. This manual [can be read from within Vim], or [found online].[31][32]
        - Vim also has a [built-in help facility](((PyZoLXNZr))) (using the `:help` command) that [allows users to] [query and navigate through commands and features].

- 交交黃鳥、止于棘。
誰從穆公、子車奄息。
維此奄息、百夫之特。

    - 棘：酸枣树。一种落叶乔木。枝上多刺，[果小][味酸]。棘[之言]“急”，双关语。
        - 据马瑞辰《毛诗传笺通释》的解释，“棘”之言“急”，是[语音相谐]的双关语，[给此诗渲染出一种]紧迫、悲哀、凄苦的氛围，为[全诗的主旨][定下了哀伤的基调]。
    - They flit about, the yellow birds,
And rest upon the jujube trees.
Who followed duke Mu [to the grave]?
Ziche Yansi.
And this Yansi,
Was a man above a hundred.
    - In flocks the [[yellow bird]]s
Flew in and out each thorny tree.—§
Who followed dead? Duke Muh?
He of the clan Tse-Kü, Yen-Si.

    - [§ ] [It seems hopeless to seek any meaning in] these [introductory lines].
    - [? ] “Dead” is not in the original, but the sense requires it. Duke Muh died 620 bc, and not only these three clansmen, but 170 persons in all, it is said, were [buried alive with him].
- 臨其穴、惴惴其慄。
彼蒼者天、殲我良人。
如可贖兮、人百其身。
    - When he came to the grave,
He looked terrified and trembled.
Thou azure Heaven there!
Thou art destroying our good men.
Could he have been redeemed,
We should have given a hundred lives for him.
    - Gazing into his grave
He shrank with shuddering dread. 吓得直哆嗦
Powers of yon blue concave!*
Our best men all lie dead.
O, could a ransom save,
A hundred died instead!
    - [* ] Lit., yonder azure Heaven!
- [‡ ] [A practice evidently learnt from] their [barbarous neighbours] [in the West], and unknown [in any other State in China].
    - 秦穆公[用殉]177人，而作者只[痛悼]“三良”，那174个[奴隶之死][却只字未提]，则[此诗作者的身分地位][不言而喻]。
    - 殉葬的恶习，春秋时代各国都有，相沿成习，不以为非。《[墨子]·节葬》篇[即云]：“天子[杀殉]，[众者]数百，[寡者]数十；[将军大夫]杀殉，众者数十，寡者[数人]。”

- [Abstract](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Modding)
    - [Modding]([[modding]]), or [creating mods], is the act of modifying the [[asset]]s or [behavior of the game] either for [[personal use]], or to [release publicly](((r5AeYZqom))) to other [[player]]s, for instance via [Paradox Mods](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/games/ck3) or the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1158310/workshop/). #[[Steam Workshop]]
    - As with all Paradox games, Crusader Kings III is [moddable to a great extent]([[moddable]]). [Motivations of modders] [may vary widely]; better translation to [[native language]], more events or decisions, better map, [[major overhaul]], [[cheating]], etc.
    - [This guide is intended to] [lower the entry barriers to the world of](((Eu46_sor_))) [Crusader Kings III modding]. However, there is still a [[learning curve]] to it, and [it cannot replace the need to] read some [working vanilla code](((TvjoQD_Uw))) and [do lots of trial]([[trial]]) and [[error experimentation]].

    - __Important__: [the majority of mods] will [change the checksum]([[checksum]]), [not allowing the player to] [get achievements]([[achievement]]). See `checksum_manifest.txt` [in the game folder] [for the list of] [checksummed folders and files]. [The only safe mods] are the ones that replace textures, shaders, fonts or music.

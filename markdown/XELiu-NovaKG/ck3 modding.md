    - [Modding]([[modding]]), or [creating mods], is the act of modifying the [[asset]]s or [[behavior]] of the game either for [[personal use]], or to [[release publicly]] to other [[player]]s, for instance via [Paradox Mods](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/games/ck3) or the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1158310/workshop/). #[[Steam Workshop]]
    - As with all Paradox games, Crusader Kings III is moddable to a great extent. Motivations of modders may vary widely; better translation to native language, more events or decisions, better map, major overhaul, cheating, etc.
    - This guide is intended to lower the entry barriers to the world of Crusader Kings III modding. However, there is still a learning curve to it, and it cannot replace the need to read some working vanilla code and do lots of trial and error experimentation.
    - __Important__: the majority of mods will change the checksum, not allowing the player to get achievements. See checksum_manifest.txt in the game folder for the list of checksummed folders and files. The only safe mods are the ones that replace textures, shaders, fonts or music.

- An elastic modulus (also known as modulus of [[elasticity]]) is a quantity that [measures an object or substance's resistance to being] [deformed elastically](((jYob2tJ4H))) (i.e., non-permanently) when a [[stress]] is applied to it. The elastic modulus of an object is defined as the [[slope]] of its [[stress–strain curve]] in the [[elastic deformation]] region:[1] [A stiffer material] will have a higher elastic modulus. An elastic modulus has the form: $${\displaystyle \delta \ {\stackrel {\text{def}}{=}}\ {\frac {\text{stress}}{\text{strain}}}}$$

    - where stress is the force [causing the deformation] [divided by the area to which the force is applied] and [[strain]] is the ratio of [the change in some parameter] [caused by the deformation] to [the original value of the parameter]. Since strain is a [[dimensionless quantity]], the units of {\displaystyle \delta }\delta  will be the same as the [[unit]]s of stress.[2](((mItLdODYI)))
- Specifying how stress and strain are to be measured, including directions, allows for many types of [elastic moduli] to be defined. The three primary ones are:
    - 1. [[Young's modulus]] (E) describes [[tensile elasticity]], or [the tendency of an object to] [deform along an axis] when [opposing forces are applied] [along that axis]; it is defined as the ratio of [[tensile stress]] to [[tensile strain]]. It is often referred to simply as the elastic modulus.

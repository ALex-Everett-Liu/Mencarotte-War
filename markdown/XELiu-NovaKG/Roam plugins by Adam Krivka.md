- ## What I'm working on
    - I just finished the MVP of pyroam and [plan to shift my focus towards] roam/sr more again, but I'm [stuck on a few conceptual and technical issues] so I'm not sure [how fast the progress is going to be] and if I might not [take another detour to some of my other ideas] ([the biggest one of which right now] is probably roam/convert - a better [markdown exporter]).

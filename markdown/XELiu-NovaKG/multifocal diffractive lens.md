- A multifocal diffractive lens is a [[diffractive optical element (DOE)]] that allows a [[single incident beam]] to be [focused simultaneously at several positions]([[focused]]) along the [[propagation axis]].

- Principle of operation
    - An incident laser beam is [[deflected]] by 偏转为 [[grooved diffraction pattern]] 沟槽 into [[axial diffraction order]]s 轴向衍射级 along its [[optical axis]]. The [[foci]] appear around the [[far field]] position. With an additional [[focusing lens]], foci from multifocal lens will [appear at certain distances] from the [[focal point]] of the lens.

- Theory
    - The multifocal spots location is a function of refractive focal length $$f_{Refractive}$$ and predetermined diffractive focal length $$f_{Diffractive}$$ The focal spot at the "zero" order refers to the refractive focal length of the lens being used.
    - The distance between the focal spots can be described by the equation
        - $${\displaystyle {\frac {1}{f_{m}}}={\frac {1}{f_{\mathrm {Refractive} }}}+{\frac {m}{f_{\mathrm {Diffractive} }}},\ \mathrm {for} \ m=\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3...},$$
        - where $$f_m$$ is the focal length for the __m__th diffractive order,
f_Refractive is the focal length of the refractive lens, and
f_Diffractive is the focal length of the diffractive lens.

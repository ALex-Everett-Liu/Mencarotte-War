- Quantum dots (QDs) are [[semiconductor particle]]s [a few nanometres in size], having [optical and electronic properties] that [differ from larger particles] [due to quantum mechanics]. They are a [central topic] in [[nanotechnology]]. When the quantum dots are illuminated by [[UV light]], [an electron in the quantum dot] [can be excited to a state of higher energy]. In the case of a [semiconducting quantum dot], [this process corresponds to] [the transition of an electron](((jy7HvZPsj))) [from the valence band to the conductance band]. 
    - The [excited electron] can [drop back into the valence band] [releasing its energy] by [the emission of light]. This [[light emission]] ([[photoluminescence]]) is [illustrated in the figure on the right]. [The color of that light] depends on the [[energy difference]] [between the conductance band and the valence band], or transition between [discretized energy states] when [[band structure]] is [no longer a good definition] in QDs.

        - Colloidal quantum dots irradiated with a UV light. Different sized quantum dots emit different colors of light due to quantum confinement.
    - In the language of materials science, nanoscale semiconductor materials tightly confine either electrons or electron holes. Quantum dots are sometimes referred to as artificial atoms, emphasizing their singularity, having bound, discrete electronic states, like naturally occurring atoms or molecules.[1][2] It was shown that the electronic wave functions in quantum dots resemble the ones in real atoms.[3] By coupling two or more such quantum dots an artificial molecule can be made, exhibiting hybridization even at room temperature.[4]
    - Quantum dots have properties intermediate between bulk semiconductors and discrete atoms or molecules. Their optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape.[5][6] Larger QDs of 5–6 nm diameter emit longer wavelengths, with colors such as orange or red. Smaller QDs (2–3 nm) emit shorter wavelengths, yielding colors like blue and green. However, the specific colors vary depending on the exact composition of the QD.[7]
    - Potential applications of quantum dots include single-electron transistors, solar cells, LEDs, lasers,[8] single-photon sources,[9][10][11] second-harmonic generation, quantum computing,[12] cell biology research,[13] microscopy,[14] and medical imaging.[15] Their small size allows for some QDs to be suspended in solution, which may lead to use in inkjet printing and spin-coating.[16] They have been used in Langmuir-Blodgett thin-films.[17][18][19] These processing techniques result in less expensive and less time-consuming methods of semiconductor fabrication.

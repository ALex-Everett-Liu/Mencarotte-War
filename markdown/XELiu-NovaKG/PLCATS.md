        - Note: [Used mainly to] [check the performance of]([[performance]]) the [[spectrometer]] or an [[accessory]]. The calculations for most of the [standard production tests] are preset. The spectrum, [[interferogram]] (if available) and [all transformation of the spectrum] can be saved. This [[view]] can be used to [acquire and save data]. [Please note that] in its [normal mode], an [interferogram acquisition] is not possible with an [MB Series spectrometer](((nrjXiix_q))).

- # Using PLCATS to [acquire data](((acioAH8u9)))
    - In this [[manual]] you will find: [[basic instruction]] how to use PLCATS to [acquire and save data]
    - 3. Go to the Analysis [[panel]]:
        - A. Set “Calculation type” to “None”.
        - B. Set the number of [[scan]] and number of [[measurement]] required.
            - Even if the number of measurement is larger than one, [only one file is saved] but [contains all sub files].
        - C. To acquire a [[raw spectrum]], in the “Convert incoming data to” section, select “Spectrum” (FTLA-FTPA Series) or “Do not transform” for [MB Series](((nrjXiix_q)))

            - If Absorbance or Transmittance is selected, a [[background spectrum]] acquisition is required prior to it. Make sure that “File” is selected in the “Reference” section before [launching the acquisition of] the [[absorbance]] or [[transmittance]].
        - D. Click on “Go” to [launch the acquisition]

        - You can write a [[book review]] and [share your experiences]. Other readers [will always be interested in your opinion] of the books you've read. Whether you've [loved the book or not], if you [give your honest and detailed thoughts] then people will find new books that are right for them.
    - This is simply another great book on the cosmos by Brian Greene. I previously read Greene's book "The Elegant Universe" and I think at [enjoyed this one even more]. Greene [packs as enormous wealth of information] in his books. Quite frankly, [it takes me considerably longer to] read one of his books [than most other books I read] because of [the volume of new information]([[information volume]]) I am learning.
        - Greene has [done a fantastic job] of [explaining the cosmos] in this work. His explanations are detailed and [lengthy enough to] [thoroughly convey the concepts discussed]. There were many concepts that I read about in other books which were [clearly delineated] in this book, and I went away with [a much better understanding].
        - Green covers a wealth of information about the cosmos such as wave probability, uncertainty, spin, entanglement, the flow and direction of time, quantum erasure, decoherence, symmetry, the various forces of nature (strong, weak, electromagnetic, gravity), Higgs field, the big bang, inflation, dark matter, dark energy, entropy, string theory, branes, time travel, the future, and much more.
        - If you want to [get a good education about] [the universe we live in], I [high recommend] Green's books.

        - Space and time [capture the imagination] like no other [scientific subject]. For good reason. They form the arena of reality, the very fabric of the cosmos. Our entire existence —everything we do, think, and experience — takes place [in some region of space] [during some interval of time]. Yet science is still [struggling to understand] what space and time actually are. Are they real [physical entities](((mPpUWBtUc))) or simply [useful ideas]? If they're real, are they fundamental, or do they [emerge from more basic constituents](((4dQlWc-5i)))? What does it mean for space to be empty? Does time [have a beginning]? Does it [have an arrow], flowing inexorably from past to future, as [[common experience]] would indicate? Can we [manipulate space and time]? In this book, we follow three hundred years of passionate 充满激情的 [scientific investigation] [seeking answers], or at least [glimpses of answers], to [such basic but deep questions] about [the nature of the universe].

        - Our journey also brings us repeatedly to another, tightly related question, as encompassing as it is elusive: What is [[reality]]'? We humans [only have access to] the [[internal experience]]s of [perception and thought], 感知和思考 so [how can we be sure] they truly reflect an [[external world]]? Philosophers have long [recognized this problem]. Filmmakers have [popularized it through story lines] involving [[artificial world]]s, generated by [finely tuned] [[neurological stimulation]] that exist solely within the minds of their [[protagonist]]s. And physicists such as myself are [acutely aware that] the reality we observe —matter evolving on the stage of space and time —may [have little to do with the reality], if any, that's out there. 
            - Nevertheless, because [[observation]]s are all we have, we take them seriously. We choose hard data and [the framework of mathematics] [as our guides], not [unrestrained imagination] 无拘无束的想象 or unrelenting [[skepticism]], and seek the simplest yet [most wide-reaching theories] capable of [explaining and predicting the outcome] of [today's and future experiments](((sCNqeIalp))). This severely [restricts the theories we pursue]. (In this book, for example, we won't [find a hint that] I'm [floating in a tank], connected to thousands of [brain-stimulating wires], making me merely think that I'm now [writing this text].) But during the last hundred years, [discoveries in physics] have suggested revisions to our [everyday sense of reality] that are as dramatic, as mind-bending, and as paradigm-shaking as the most imaginative [[science fiction]]. These [revolutionary upheavals] will [frame our passage] [through the pages that follow]. 架构我们的通道

        - Many of [the questions we explore] are the same ones that, [in various guises](((9VJNkwZfz))), [furrowed the brows of] Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and countless others through the ages. And because this book seeks to convey science in the making, we follow these questions as they've been declared answered by one generation, overturned by their successors, and refined and reinterpreted 提炼和重新解释 by scientists in the centuries that followed.
            - For example, on the [perplexing question](((HP88EcTnX))) of whether [completely empty space]([[empty space]]) is, like [a blank canvas](((J0s-SMGkE))), a [[real entity]] or merely an [[abstract idea]], we [follow the pendulum of](((bmeg137-W))) [[scientific opinion]] as it swings between Isaac Newton's seventeenth-century declaration that space is real, [[Ernst Mach]]'s conclusion in the nineteenth century that it isn't, and Einstein's twentieth-century dramatic [reformulation of the question itself], in which he [merged space and time], and [largely refuted](((2qyxrZm0V))) Mach. 
                - We then [encounter subsequent discoveries] that [transformed the question once again] by redefining the meaning of "empty," envisioning that space is unavoidably [suffused with] what are called [[quantum field]]s and possibly a [diffuse uniform energy](((AjJr-pCcp))) called a [[cosmological constant]]—[modern echoes of] the [old and discredited notion] of a [space-filling aether]([[aether]]). What's more, we then describe how upcoming [[space-based experiment]]s may [confirm particular features of] Mach's conclusions that [happen to agree with] Einstein's [[general relativity]], illustrating well the fascinating and [tangled web] of [[scientific development]].

            - In our own era we encounter [[inflationary cosmology]]'s [gratifying insights into] [time's arrow]([[time arrow]]), 令人兴奋的洞见 [[string theory]]'s rich assortment of [extra spatial dimensions](((nVe8Psp5u))), [[M-theory]]'s [radical suggestion] 激进的设想 that [the space we inhabit] may be but [a sliver floating in a grander cosmos], 在一个更广阔的宇宙中漂浮的[薄片, 成小片, 剖成长条] and the [current wild speculation] that [the universe we see] [may be nothing more than] a [[cosmic hologram]]. [We don't yet know] if [the more recent of] these [theoretical proposals] are right. But outrageous as they sound, we [take them seriously] because they are where our [dogged search] for [the deepest laws of the universe] leads. Not only can [a strange and unfamiliar reality] arise from the [fertile imagination] of science fiction, but one may also emerge from the [cutting-edge findings] of [modem physics]. 前沿发现

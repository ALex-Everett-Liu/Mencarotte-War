        - You can write a [[book review]] and [share your experiences]. Other readers [will always be interested in your opinion] of the books you've read. Whether you've [loved the book or not], if you [give your honest and detailed thoughts] then people will find new books that are right for them.
    - This is simply another great book on the cosmos by Brian Greene. I previously read Greene's book "The Elegant Universe" and I think at [enjoyed this one even more]. Greene [packs as enormous wealth of information] in his books. Quite frankly, [it takes me considerably longer to] read one of his books [than most other books I read] because of [the volume of new information]([[information volume]]) I am learning.
        - Greene has [done a fantastic job] of [explaining the cosmos] in this work. His explanations are detailed and [lengthy enough to] [thoroughly convey the concepts discussed]. There were many concepts that I read about in other books which were [clearly delineated] in this book, and I went away with [a much better understanding].
        - Green covers a wealth of information about the cosmos such as wave probability, uncertainty, spin, entanglement, the flow and direction of time, quantum erasure, decoherence, symmetry, the various forces of nature (strong, weak, electromagnetic, gravity), Higgs field, the big bang, inflation, dark matter, dark energy, entropy, string theory, branes, time travel, the future, and much more.
        - If you want to [get a good education about] [the universe we live in], I [high recommend] Green's books.

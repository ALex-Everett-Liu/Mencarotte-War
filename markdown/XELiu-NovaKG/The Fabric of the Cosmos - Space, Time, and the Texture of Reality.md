        - You can write a [[book review]] and [share your experiences]. Other readers [will always be interested in your opinion] of the books you've read. Whether you've [loved the book or not], if you [give your honest and detailed thoughts] then people will find new books that are right for them.
    - This is simply another great book on the cosmos by Brian Greene. I previously read Greene's book "The Elegant Universe" and I think at [enjoyed this one even more]. Greene [packs as enormous wealth of information] in his books. Quite frankly, [it takes me considerably longer to] read one of his books [than most other books I read] because of [the volume of new information]([[information volume]]) I am learning.
        - Greene has [done a fantastic job] of [explaining the cosmos] in this work. His explanations are detailed and [lengthy enough to] [thoroughly convey the concepts discussed]. There were many concepts that I read about in other books which were [clearly delineated] in this book, and I went away with [a much better understanding].
        - Green covers a wealth of information about the cosmos such as wave probability, uncertainty, spin, entanglement, the flow and direction of time, quantum erasure, decoherence, symmetry, the various forces of nature (strong, weak, electromagnetic, gravity), Higgs field, the big bang, inflation, dark matter, dark energy, entropy, string theory, branes, time travel, the future, and much more.
        - If you want to [get a good education about] [the universe we live in], I [high recommend] Green's books.

        - Space and time [capture the imagination] like no other [scientific subject]. For good reason. They form the arena of reality, the very fabric of the cosmos. Our entire existence —everything we do, think, and experience — takes place [in some region of space] [during some interval of time]. Yet science is still [struggling to understand] what space and time actually are. Are they real [physical entities](((mPpUWBtUc))) or simply [useful ideas]? If they're real, are they fundamental, or do they [emerge from more basic constituents](((4dQlWc-5i)))? What does it mean for space to be empty? Does time [have a beginning]? Does it [have an arrow], flowing inexorably from past to future, as [[common experience]] would indicate? Can we [manipulate space and time]? In this book, we follow three hundred years of passionate 充满激情的 [scientific investigation] [seeking answers], or at least [glimpses of answers], to [such basic but deep questions] about [the nature of the universe].
(空间是空的吗-如何操纵时空)
        - Our journey also brings us repeatedly to another, tightly related question, as encompassing as it is elusive: What is [[reality]]'? We humans [only have access to] the [[internal experience]]s of [perception and thought], 感知和思考 so [how can we be sure] they truly reflect an [[external world]]? Philosophers have long [recognized this problem]. Filmmakers have [popularized it through story lines] involving [[artificial world]]s, generated by [finely tuned] [[neurological stimulation]] that exist solely within the minds of their [[protagonist]]s. And physicists such as myself are [acutely aware that] the reality we observe —matter evolving on the stage of space and time —may [have little to do with the reality], if any, that's out there. 
            - Nevertheless, because [[observation]]s are all we have, we take them seriously. We choose hard data and [the framework of mathematics] [as our guides], not [unrestrained imagination] 无拘无束的想象 or unrelenting [[skepticism]], and seek the simplest yet [most wide-reaching theories] capable of [explaining and predicting the outcome] of [today's and future experiments](((sCNqeIalp))). This severely [restricts the theories we pursue]. (In this book, for example, we won't [find a hint that] I'm [floating in a tank], connected to thousands of [brain-stimulating wires], making me merely think that I'm now [writing this text].) But during the last hundred years, [discoveries in physics] have suggested revisions to our [everyday sense of reality] that are as dramatic, as mind-bending, and as paradigm-shaking as the most imaginative [[science fiction]]. These [revolutionary upheavals] will [frame our passage] [through the pages that follow]. 架构我们的通道

- In astrophysics and [[physical cosmology]], Olbers' paradox, [named after] the [German astronomer] [Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers] (1758â€“1840), also known as the "dark night sky paradox", is the argument that the darkness of the [[night sky]] [conflicts with the assumption of] [an infinite and eternal static universe]. [In the hypothetical case that] [the universe is static](((2_Hb6NP4y))), homogeneous [at a large scale], and populated by [an infinite number of stars], [any line of sight from Earth] must [end at the surface of a star] and hence the night sky should be [completely illuminated] and very bright. This contradicts the observed darkness and non-uniformity of the night.[1]

    - The darkness of the night sky is one of the pieces of evidence for a dynamic universe, such as the Big Bang model. That model explains the observed non-uniformity of brightness by invoking spacetime's expansion, which lengthens the light originating from the Big Bang to microwave levels via a process known as redshift; this microwave radiation background has wavelengths much longer than those of visible light, and so appears dark to the naked eye.[citation needed] Other explanations for the paradox have been offered, but none have wide acceptance in cosmology.

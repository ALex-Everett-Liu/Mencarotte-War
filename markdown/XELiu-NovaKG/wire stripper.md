- ## Types
    - ### Manual
        - A US-style simple [manual wire stripper] is [a pair of opposing blades]([[blade]]) 相对的刀片 much like [[scissor]]s or [[wire cutter]]s. 钢丝钳 The addition of a [[center notch]] [makes it easier to] [cut the insulation] [without cutting the wire]. This type of wire stripper is used by [rotating it around the insulation] while [applying pressure in order to] [make a cut around the insulation]. Since the insulation is not [bonded to the wire], 黏合 it then [pulls easily off the end]. This type of wire stripper [can be used on] [wires of any size]. 
            - Another type of manual wire stripper is very similar to the [simple design] [previously mentioned], except this type has [several notches] of [varying size]. [This allows the user to] [match the notch size to] the [wire size], thereby [eliminating the need for twisting], but can only be used on [[wire size]]s that [approximately match] [one of the notches]. __Once the device is clamped on, 被夹紧 [the remainder of the wire] 剩下的导线 [can simply be pulled out], 拔出 leaving the insulation behind.__

        - European-style wire strippers [look more like] a [[notched pincer]], with a [[grab]] that is adjusted with a [[screw]].

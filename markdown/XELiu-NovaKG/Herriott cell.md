- The Herriott cell first appeared in 1965 when [[Donald R. Herriott]] and Harry J. Schulte published [Folded Optical Delay Lines] while at [[Bell Laboratories]]. The Herriott cell is made up of two opposing [[spherical mirror]]s. [A hole is machined into one of the mirrors] to allow [the input and output beams] to [enter and exit the cavity]([[cavity]]). Alternatively, the beam may [exit through a hole] [in the opposite mirror]. In this fashion the Herriott cell can [support multiple light sources] by [providing multiple entrance and exit holes] [in either of the mirrors]. Unlike the [[White cell]], [the number of traversals] is controlled by adjusting the [[separation distance]] D [between the two mirrors]. This cell is also commonly used and has some advantages over the White cell:
(光束可以从任意一边的球面镜的孔洞中射出腔体-可以有多个光源进出多个孔洞，实现多通道-通过调节间距来控制反射次数)

    - It is simpler than the White cell with only two mirrors that are [easier to position] and [less susceptible to] [[mechanical disturbance]] of the cell
    - [Can be more stable than] the White cell
- However, the Herriot cell does not accept [high numerical aperture beams]([[numerical aperture]]). 高数值孔径光束 In addition, [larger sized mirrors] must be used when longer [[path length]]s are needed.
- # PCI-HC10m - 10.1m Herriott Cell
    - General purpose, economical [multipass Herriott cell] [for laboratory and field use]. This [gas flow cell] provides 10.1m of [optical absorption pathlength] and is [well constructed] with [honed and polished] [[interior wall]]s and high-quality 1/10 wave protected gold mirrors.

    - [Useable over the 1-5 micron wavelength range] and [the 0.001 to 1.2 Bar pressure range] with an easily replaceable 1” diameter coupling window. Cells are [electroless nickel plated inside and out] 无电解镍电镀 for [[corrosion resistance]] 耐腐蚀性 and a lower [“sticking” coefficient] 粘附系数 for [[polar gas]]es. A matched [Kapton heater element] is also available for operation [at stable elevated temperatures] (to 85C). 在稳定的高温下

    - ### ALIGNMENT FIXTURE
        - A [bolt-on alignment fixture] [with optional visible (red) laser] is available to aid in [[beam alignment]]. [Two adjustable irises are positioned on a shelf]([[iris diaphragm]]) which [defines the entry beam angle needed to] [produce the correct number of passes] and [a visible output spot]. Both the laser and the [alignment fixture] are [easily removed], leaving [the alignment shelf mounting holes] 校准架安装孔 available for [user-made assemblies] such as [GRIN lens mounts] and other [laser and detector mounts] 支架 to [couple suitable 1-5 μm lasers to the Herriott cell].

        - All cells are pre-aligned before shipping. With the far mirror adjustment capability it is possible to further optimize the system to maximize output power and minimize optical fringing for a given laser and detector combination. The alignment fixture is especially useful for students or other researchers with no prior experience using Herriott cells for spectroscopic measurements, and can be supplied with, or without, the visible alignment laser module.

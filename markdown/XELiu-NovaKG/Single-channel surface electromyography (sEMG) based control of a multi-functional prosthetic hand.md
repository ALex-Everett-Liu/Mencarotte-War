- Abstract
    - Patients [suffering from upper limb amputation] 上肢截肢 [experience a significant reduction in] their [ability to perform various tasks]. The [currently available] [myoelectric prostheses] 肌电假肢 seek to [reinstate the lost abilities of the amputees]. However, [most users] [abandon their devices] due to [high cost], large size, heavy weight, complexity, and [limited functional control]. 
    - [This paper presents] a [multifunctional prosthetic hand] that can [perform six hand activities] deploying a [single-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) sensor]. [EMG signals] for fifteen subjects (five amputees 被截肢者 and ten intact) were acquired for [six contraction levels] of 收缩水平 [forearm muscles] 前臂肌肉 using the [designed sensor]. These levels were [further classified to recognize] six [predefined hand gestures] by a [[fuzzy logic classifier]].

        - The [automatic modulation identification] of [communication signals] 调制信号的自动识别 based on fuzzy logic classifier is realized. dict.cnki.net
    - The [proposed system] [showed an excellent success] (> 95%) and other [performance parameters] above 96%. The intended [classification-based control scheme] was further [realized in real-time] to achieve six [grip patterns] 抓握 for the developed [prosthetic prototype]. The hand was [tested on five subjects] (two amputees and three intact) [showed a percentage of success above] 91% for accomplishing the [dexterous grasping operations]. The [proposed approach] is modest, efficient, and [provides a low-cost solution to] amputees [with multiple degrees of freedom] with a [single channel EMG system].

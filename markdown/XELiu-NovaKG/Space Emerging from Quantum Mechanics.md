- [The other day] [I was amused to] find [a quote from Einstein](https://twitter.com/seanmcarroll/status/754357519506477056), in 1936, about [how hard it would be to] [[quantize gravity]]: “[like an attempt to] [breathe in empty space].” Eight decades later, I think we can still agree that it’s hard.
210626-22:03
- So here is a possibility [worth considering]: rather than quantizing gravity, [maybe we should try to] [gravitize quantum mechanics](((GNyD7gLPd))). Or, [more accurately] but [less evocatively], 更准确但不那么引人入胜 “find gravity inside quantum mechanics.” Rather than starting with some [essentially classical view of gravity](((h2CUtldR0))) and “quantizing” it, [we might imagine starting with] [a quantum view of reality] [from the start], and find the [ordinary three-dimensional space] [in which we live] somehow [emerging from quantum information]. [That’s the project that] [ChunJun (Charles) Cao], Spyridon (Spiros) Michalakis, and I [take a few tentative steps toward] in [a new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08444).

- We human beings, [even those who have been] [studying quantum mechanics] [for a long time], [still think in terms of] a [classical concepts]. Positions, momenta, particles, fields, space itself. Quantum mechanics [tells a different story]. The [[quantum state]] of the universe is not [a collection of things] [distributed through space], [but something called] a [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function). The [[wave function]] [gives us a way of] [calculating the outcomes of measurements](((sCNqeIalp))): whenever we measure an [[observable quantity]] like the position or momentum or [spin of a particle], the wave function [has a value for every possible outcome], and [the probability of obtaining that outcome] [is given by the wave function squared]. Indeed, that’s typically [how we construct wave functions in practice]. Start with some [classical-sounding notion] like “the position of a particle” or “the amplitude of a field,” and [to each possible value] we [attach a complex number]. That complex number, squared, [gives us the probability of] [observing the system] [with that observed value].
(构造波函数的实例-)
210627-00:30
    - Mathematically, wave functions are elements of a [[mathematical structure]] called [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space). That means they are vectors — we can [add quantum states together] (the origin of [superpositions]([[quantum superposition]]) in quantum mechanics) and calculate the angle (“[[dot product]]”) between them. (We’re [skipping over some technicalities here], especially regarding [[complex number]]s — see e.g. __[The Theoretical Minimum](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-Theoretical-Leonard-Susskind/dp/0465062903/)__ for more.) The word “space” in “[[Hilbert space]]” doesn’t mean [the good old three-dimensional space] [we walk through every day], or even the [four-dimensional spacetime] of relativity. [It’s just math-speak for] “a collection of things,” in this case “possible quantum states of the universe.”
(波函数-宇宙中可能的量子态-空间中分布的一组事物-一种特殊数学结构中的元素-希尔伯特空间)
210627-01:00
    - Hilbert space is [quite an abstract thing], which can [seem at times pretty removed from] the [tangible phenomena] of [our everyday lives]. 与[我们日常生活中的][有形现象][相去甚远] This leads [some people to wonder](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/05/29/quantum-mechanics-smackdown/) [whether we need to supplement] [ordinary quantum mechanics] by [additional new variables], or [alternatively to imagine that] wave functions [reflect our knowledge of the world], rather than [being representations of reality]. [For purposes of this post] I’ll take the [straightforward](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/) view that quantum mechanics says that the [real world] is [best described by] a wave function, an element of Hilbert space, evolving through time. (Of course time could be emergent too … something for another day.)
(有些人认为波函数仅仅是我们对于世界的知识的一种反映，而非实在的真正表达-而 Carroll 则认为，真实世界即空间就是由波函数完全描述的，时间同样由之涌现)
    - Here’s the thing: we can [construct a Hilbert space by] [starting with a classical idea like] “all possible positions of a particle” and [attaching a complex number to each value], obtaining a wave function. [All the conceivable wave functions of that form] [constitute the Hilbert space] [we’re interested in]. But we don’t __have__ to do it that way. As Einstein [might have said], God doesn’t do it that way. Once we [make wave functions by] [quantizing some classical system](((8qDQAika9))), we have states that [live in Hilbert space]. [At this point] [it essentially doesn’t matter] [where we came from]; now we’re in Hilbert space and we’ve left our [classical starting point] behind. Indeed, [it’s well-known that] very different [classical theories] [lead to the same theory] [when we quantize them], and likewise some [quantum theories] [don’t have classical predecessors at all]. #[[phys/pt10-100]]
(一旦我们通过量子化某个经典系统从而构建出了一个波函数，我们就此进入了希尔伯特空间之中，那个经典系统原本的我们所熟悉的三维空间就不再重要了，原本的三维空间与构建出的希尔伯特空间不存在一一对应的关系)
210627-12:25
        - The [[real world]] simply is quantum-mechanical [from the start]; it’s not [a quantization of some classical system]. The universe is described by an element of Hilbert space. All of our [usual classical notions] [should be derived from that], not the other way around. Even space itself. We think of the space through which we move as one of [the most basic and irreducible constituents] of the real world, [but it might be better thought of] as [an approximate notion that emerges](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/11/10/against-space/) [at large distances] and [low energies].
(然而现实世界本质上就是量子化的，不存在原本的某个经典系统这种表述，反倒是一切经典的概念都是从希尔伯特空间中推导出来的-我们通常认为空间是现实世界最基本的不可分的组成元素之一，然而，空间更可能是在大尺度和低能条件下涌现出的一个近似概念)
210627-12:42
    - [So here is the task] [we set for ourselves]: start with [a quantum state in Hilbert space]. Not [a random or generic state], admittedly; a particular kind of state. Divide Hilbert space up into pieces — technically, [factors that we multiply together to] [make the whole space]. Use quantum information — in particular, the amount of [[quantum entanglement]] [between different parts of the state], as measured by the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) — to define a “distance” between them. [Parts that are highly entangled] [are considered to be nearby], while [unentangled parts] are far away. This gives us a graph, in which [[vertices]] are the [different parts] of Hilbert space, and [the edges are weighted by] the [emergent distance] between them. #[[mutual information]]
        - ![](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/rc-graph.jpg)
        - We can then ask two questions:
            - When we zoom out, does the graph [take on the geometry of] a smooth, [flat space] [with a fixed number of dimensions]? (Answer: yes, when we [put in the right kind of state to start with].)
            - If we [perturb the state a little bit], how does the [emergent geometry] change? (Answer: [space curves] [in response to emergent mass/energy], [in a way reminiscent of] [Einstein’s equation in general relativity].)
(涌现出的几何构造-施加能量扰动后，如何变形-这样看来，时空曲率似乎并不难以获得)
        - It’s that last bit that is most exciting, but also most speculative. The claim, in its most dramatic-sounding form, is that gravity ([[spacetime curvature]] caused by energy/momentum) [isn’t hard to obtain] [in quantum mechanics] — it’s automatic! Or at least, [the most natural thing] to expect. If geometry is defined by entanglement and quantum information, then [perturbing the state](((Z5_VJUAOq))) (e.g. by adding energy) [naturally changes that geometry]. And [if the model matches onto] an [emergent field theory] [at large distances], [the most natural relationship between] energy and curvature is given by [Einstein’s equation]. [The optimistic view is that] gravity [just pops out effortlessly] [in the classical limit of] [an appropriate quantum system]. But the devil is in the details, and [there’s a long way to go] [before we can declare victory].
210627-16:32
- Here’s the abstract for our paper:
    - [Space from Hilbert Space: Recovering Geometry from Bulk Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08444)
    - __ChunJun Cao, Sean M. Carroll, Spyridon Michalakis__
    - We examine [how to construct] a [[spatial manifold]] and its geometry from the [[entanglement structure]] of [an abstract quantum state] [in Hilbert space]. Given a decomposition of Hilbert space __H__ into a [[tensor product]] of factors, we consider a class of “[[redundancy-constrained state]]s” in __H__ that [generalize](((GAvQgjvhW))) the [[area-law behavior]] for [[entanglement entropy]] usually found in [[condensed-matter system]]s with [[gapped local Hamiltonian]]s. Using mutual information to define a [[distance measure]] [on the graph], we employ classical [[multidimensional scaling]] to extract the best-fit [[spatial dimensionality]] of the [[emergent geometry]]. 
210627-18:55
        - [We then show that] [[entanglement perturbation]]s on such [emergent geometries] [naturally give rise to] [[local modification]]s of [spatial curvature] which [obey a (spatial) analog of] [[Einstein’s equation]]. [The Hilbert space corresponding to] [a region of flat space] is finite-dimensional and [scales as the volume](((M7oYvwWX6))), though the entropy (and the maximum change thereof) [scales like] [the area of the boundary](((OsJEFXYP2))). A version of the [[ER=EPR]] conjecture is recovered, in that perturbations that [entangle distant parts of the emergent geometry] [generate a configuration] that [may be considered as] a highly [[quantum wormhole]].
(希尔伯特空间的尺度成比例于所对应的有限维空间的体积，纠缠熵则成比例于边界的面积)
210627-21:53
- Like almost any [physics paper], we’re [building on ideas that have come before]. The idea that [spacetime geometry is related to entanglement](https://inspirehep.net/record/1295886?ln=en) [has become increasingly popular], although [it’s mostly been explored in] the [holographic context](((1UK6DM_42))) of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]; [here we’re working directly in] [the “bulk” region of space], not appealing to [a faraway boundary]. [A related notion] is the [ER=EPR](https://inspirehep.net/record/1236661?ln=en) conjecture of Maldacena and Susskind, relating entanglement to [wormholes](https://quantumfrontiers.com/2013/06/07/entanglement-wormholes/). In some sense, we’re [making this proposal] [a bit more specific], by [giving a formula for] [distance as a function of entanglement]. 
    - [The relationship of geometry to energy] [comes from something called] [the Entanglement First Law], articulated by [Faulkner et al.](https://inspirehep.net/record/1275672?ln=en), and used by [Ted Jacobson](https://inspirehep.net/record/1370675?ln=en) in a version of [entropic gravity](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/02/08/guest-post-grant-remmen-on-entropic-gravity/). But [as far as we know] [we’re the first to start directly from] Hilbert space, rather than [assuming classical variables], a boundary, or a [[background spacetime]]. ([There’s an enormous amount of work] that has been done [in closely related areas], obviously, so [I’d love to hear about anything in particular that] [we should know about].) #[[entropic gravity]]

210627-22:56
    - [We’re quick to admit that] [what we’ve done here] is [extremely preliminary and conjectural]. 非常初步的和推测的 [We don’t have] [a full theory of anything], and even [what we do] [have involves a great deal of speculating] and not yet enough [rigorous calculating].
    - Most importantly, [we’ve assumed that] [parts of Hilbert space that] are [highly entangled](((-tNN1oxOM))) are also “nearby,” but we haven’t actually [derived that fact]. It’s certainly what __should__ happen, according to our [current understanding] of [[quantum field theory]]. [It might seem like] [[entangled particles]] [can be as far apart as you like], but [the contribution of particles to the overall entanglement] is [almost completely negligible] — it’s the [[quantum vacuum]] itself that [carries almost all of the entanglement], and that’s how we [derive our geometry].
(本文的一个假设是：所关注的高度纠缠的希尔伯特空间中的部分同时是相互临近的-当然存在相距几乎无穷远但是仍然纠缠着的粒子，但其对总体量子纠缠的贡献几乎可以忽略不计-^^量子真空本身贡献了几乎全部的量子纠缠，也从而涌现出了时空几何^^)
210627-23:47, 23:55
    - [But it remains to be seen] [whether this notion really matches] [what we think of] as “distance.” To do that, [it’s not sufficient to] [talk about space], we also need to talk about time, and [how states evolve]. That’s an obvious [next step], but one [we’ve just begun to think about]. It raises a variety of [intimidating questions]. What is the [appropriate Hamiltonian] that actually [generates time evolution]? Is time [fundamental and continuous], or [emergent and discrete]? Can we derive an [[emergent theory]] that includes not only [curved space and time], but other [[quantum field]]s? Will those fields satisfy the [[relativistic condition]] of being invariant under [[Lorentz transformation]]s? Will gravity, in particular, have [[propagating degrees of freedom]] corresponding to [[spin-2 graviton]]s? (And only one kind of graviton, coupled universally to energy-momentum?) 普遍耦合 [Full employment] for the [immediate future].

210628-00:07
    - Perhaps [the most interesting and provocative feature] [of what we’ve done] is that we [start from an assumption that] the degrees of freedom [corresponding to any particular region of space] are described by a __finite-dimensional__ Hilbert space. In some sense this is natural, as it follows from the [Bekenstein bound](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein_bound) (on the total entropy that can fit in a region) or the [holographic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle) (which limits [[degrees of freedom (DoF)]] by [the area of the boundary of their region]([[boundary area]])). #[[Bekenstein bound]] #[[holographic principle]]
        - But on the other hand, [it’s completely contrary to] [what we’re used to thinking about] from quantum field theory, which [generally assumes that] [the number of degrees of freedom] [in any region of space](((1-ild6qVd))) is [infinitely big], corresponding to an [[infinite-dimensional Hilbert space]]. (By itself that’s not so worrisome; a single [[simple harmonic oscillator]] is described by an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, just because its energy [can be arbitrarily large].) People like [Jacobson](https://inspirehep.net/record/1112813?ln=en) and [Seth Lloyd](https://inspirehep.net/record/1120267?ln=en) have argued, on pretty general grounds, that [any theory with gravity] will locally be described by [[finite-dimensional Hilbert space]]s.
(本文中假设，对应于任意空间区域的自由度由一个有限维希尔伯特空间来描述-贝肯斯坦束缚：有限大空间区域的总熵值是有限的-全息原理：自由度受区域的边界表面积的限制-量子场论中则假设，空间任何区域的自由度数目无限大，对应于无限维希尔伯特空间-这在量子场论中不是一个问题，一个简谐振子同样是由无限维希尔伯特空间描述的，因为它的能量可以是任意大的-但是，任何与引力相关的理论，局域的能量都必须由有限维希尔伯特空间来描述)
210628-04:52, 09:55, 10:00
        - That’s a big deal, if true, and [I don’t think we physicists have really] [absorbed the consequences of the idea] as yet. Field theory is embedded in [how we think about the world]; all of the [notorious infinities] of [[particle physics]] that [we work so hard to] [renormalize away](((sF0RbSmiB))) [owe their existence to the fact that] [there are an infinite number of degrees of freedom]. [A finite-dimensional Hilbert space] [describes a very different world] indeed. In many ways, it’s [a much simpler world] — one that [should be easier to understand]. We shall see.
(粒子物理学和量子场论中所有的需要重整化的无限大计算结果全都是来源于无限大自由度)
210628-10:15
- [Part of me thinks that] [a picture along these lines] — geometry emerging from quantum information, [obeying a version of Einstein’s equation] [in the classical limit] — pretty much __has__ to be true, if you believe (1) [regions of space] [have a finite number of degrees of freedom], and (2) [the world is described by] [a wave function in Hilbert space]. Those are [fairly reasonable postulates], all by themselves, [but of course] [there could be any number of twists and turns to] [get where we want to go], 迂回曲折 if indeed it’s possible. [Personally I think] [the prospects are exciting], and [I’m eager to see] [where these ideas lead us].

    - Hi Sean,
I was just reading your paper yesterday! Or tried to read it – I don’t think I [really understood it] :/ I have a question for you. If you’d [take a different starting point], not by [constructing space from the Hilbert-space] by [introducing a distance measure] [based on entanglement], but by instead [defining space as] that variable which [makes a Hamiltonian local], would that pop out the metric as the thing necessary to [contract the local terms]? [I’m wondering about this] because this might tell you more about just what limit one is taking there and about the Hamiltonian rather than just the Hilbert space. (It might also help with the [Lorentz-invariance issue].)
        - Best,
B.
        - **[BEE](http://backreaction.blogspot.com/)**
    - The [EPR paradox] [rests on the notion that] [far-apart entangled entities] [violate the finiteness of the speed of light]. If [spatial distance] is [redefined as related to the level of entanglement], the [paradoxal nature] of EPR [might just go away]. ([Tightly entangled entities] are [as near as appropriate], regardless of the [conventional distance] between them.) Is that so in the CCM idea? And if so, [what’s the nature of] [the emergent speed of light]?

    - Thanks for the interesting post. I’m following this whole area closely—[my training is in] [quantum information theory], so there’s at least one half of the arguments [I’m able to understand].
        - I think an interesting precursor, at least in spirit, is the program due to C. F. v. Weizsäcker with his ‘ur theory’, originating sometime in the 50s I believe: to the best of my knowledge, [he was the first to propose that] space should emerge from the quantum, rather than there being some sort of [quantization of gravity]. His [basic starting point] was a reconstruction of what he called ‘abstract quantum theory’, that is, a theory [not stemming from] the quantization of some [concrete system], but rather, an [axiomatic framework] based on the notion of his ‘ur alternative’ (which is basically a [dichotomous measurement], a bit, or, in the quantum version, what would today be called a qubit), from which then everything else was [supposed to be derived]—space and time, gravitation, even particles and forces.
        - His argumentation was very heuristic at times, and he (and his collaborators) ultimately couldn’t carry the program through to completion, and [it’s far from clear] whether it’s possible at all; [but I like to think of] the [modern approach] as at least its [spiritual successor]. Unfortunately, [much of the literature on this approach] is in German; there does exist a recent [English version] of Weizsäcker’s __Der Aufbau der Physik__, as __The Structure of Physics__, translated by Holger Lyre and Thomas Görnitz, if you’re interested. Also, some papers of Lyre, such as [this one](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9611048), probably work as the best [commonly-available introduction to] (and, to some extent, continuation of) the program.

    - Exciting stuff — thanks for [letting us peek over your shoulder] like this!
        - This seems to me, as a layperson, [very closely related to something] I’ve been thinking a fair bit about recently.
        - If we are to take seriously that everything is waves, then [there’s something big missing from] [all the for-the-lay-audience explanations] of QM. 为观众提供的解释 Take the double-slit experiment: the electron wave diffracts past the slits; when it reaches the detector, magic happens. It might be the collapse of the wave function or [the branching of the universe] or whatever…
            - …but __all__ those explanations only make sense if the detector is, itself, a monolithic classical (if not Platonic) entity. 庞大而单调的
            - But if it’s instead an assemblage of waves…then “detection” can __only__ mean the interaction of one of the electron waves in the detector with the diffracted electron wave — a [phosphorus atom] absorbs the electron and spits it back out with a photon, [a charge is induced in] [an element in the CCD array], whatever.

- # zhihu
    - [看到这个问题][我立刻就联想到][以前看到的] Sean Carroll 的[一篇 blog](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/07/18/space-emerging-from-quantum-mechanics/)。回去找了一下，果然找到了：
        - 这个问题，也许在10年前，会得到断然的否定。但是现在却[有了一些新的东西]，很有趣，但是也[很初步]，还属于[脑洞阶段]。
    - 严格讲，Carroll 所做的工作，和[题主的问题][并不严格一样]。[他的猜想是][时空涌现于量子纠缠]。[这里问的是][坍缩]。但是坍缩其实也是[量子纠缠的一种表象] - 如果我们接受按照[多世界-退相干的纲领]的话。
    - 关于时空结构与量子纠缠的关系，最著名的莫过于 ER=EPR 了。但是这里主要介绍一下 Carroll 的猜想。
    - 首先，前面我说，量子坍缩是量子纠缠的一种表象。[这个观点]虽然并不算是[被学界一致认同]，但是随着[退相干理论]的[日益成为共识]，这种观点也算是一种[相对主流]了。
        - 比如说，S 是一个[双态系统](((pWiMZl9UW)))，对应着它的两个态，我们[有一台观察仪器]也有两个[相应的记录状态]。在发生观察之前，[仪器的状态]是“就绪”。发生了观察之后，它的状态就变成了“记录了一种结果”。为方便计，我们把仪器的“就绪”状态记做 $$\varnothing$$，把“记录了系统状态为1”的状态记做1，把“记录了系统状态为0”的状态记做0。如果[系统一开始][处于某种本征态]，那么[仪器的观察][不会改变系统的状态]，而[相应地][其记录中]就会[产生与系统对应的状态]。
            - $$\begin{aligned}
|0\rangle_{S}|\varnothing\rangle_{A} & \Rightarrow|0\rangle_{S}|0\rangle_{A} \\
|1\rangle_{S}|\varnothing\rangle_{A} & \Rightarrow|1\rangle_{S}|1\rangle_{A}
\end{aligned}$$
            - 按照[退相干理论]，[观察过程][满足薛定谔方程]，那么对于s的[任意状态]： $$\psi_s=a|0\rangle_s+b|1\rangle_s$$
                - 根据薛定谔方程的[线性演化]： $$\psi_s\psi_A=\left( a|0\rangle_s+b|1\rangle_s \right)|\varnothing\rangle_A\Rightarrow a|0\rangle_s|0\rangle_A+b|1\rangle_s |1\rangle_A$$
                - 我们可以看到，[系统和仪器][共同演化形成了](((Um3QABrqP)))**纠缠态**。

- [The other day] [I was amused to] find [a quote from Einstein](https://twitter.com/seanmcarroll/status/754357519506477056), in 1936, about [how hard it would be to] [[quantize gravity]]: “[like an attempt to] [breathe in empty space].” Eight decades later, I think we can still agree that it’s hard.
210626-22:03
- So here is a possibility [worth considering]: rather than quantizing gravity, [maybe we should try to] [gravitize quantum mechanics](((GNyD7gLPd))). Or, [more accurately] but [less evocatively], 更准确但不那么引人入胜 “find gravity inside quantum mechanics.” Rather than starting with some [essentially classical view of gravity](((h2CUtldR0))) and “quantizing” it, [we might imagine starting with] [a quantum view of reality] [from the start], and find the [ordinary three-dimensional space] [in which we live] somehow [emerging from quantum information]. [That’s the project that] [ChunJun (Charles) Cao], Spyridon (Spiros) Michalakis, and I [take a few tentative steps toward] in [a new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08444).

- We human beings, [even those who have been] [studying quantum mechanics] [for a long time], [still think in terms of] a [classical concepts]. Positions, momenta, particles, fields, space itself. Quantum mechanics [tells a different story]. The [[quantum state]] of the universe is not [a collection of things] [distributed through space], [but something called] a [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function). The [[wave function]] [gives us a way of] [calculating the outcomes of measurements](((sCNqeIalp))): whenever we measure an [[observable quantity]] like the position or momentum or [spin of a particle], the wave function [has a value for every possible outcome], and [the probability of obtaining that outcome] [is given by the wave function squared]. Indeed, that’s typically [how we construct wave functions in practice]. Start with some [classical-sounding notion] like “the position of a particle” or “the amplitude of a field,” and [to each possible value] we [attach a complex number]. That complex number, squared, [gives us the probability of] [observing the system] [with that observed value].

    - Mathematically, wave functions are elements of a [[mathematical structure]] called [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space). That means they are vectors — we can [add quantum states together] (the origin of [superpositions]([[quantum superposition]]) in quantum mechanics) and calculate the angle (“[[dot product]]”) between them. (We’re [skipping over some technicalities here], especially regarding [[complex number]]s — see e.g. __[The Theoretical Minimum](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-Theoretical-Leonard-Susskind/dp/0465062903/)__ for more.) The word “space” in “[[Hilbert space]]” doesn’t mean [the good old three-dimensional space] [we walk through every day], or even the [four-dimensional spacetime] of relativity. [It’s just math-speak for] “a collection of things,” in this case “possible quantum states of the universe.”

    - Hilbert space is [quite an abstract thing], which can [seem at times pretty removed from] the [tangible phenomena] of [our everyday lives]. 与[我们日常生活中的][有形现象][相去甚远] This leads [some people to wonder](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/05/29/quantum-mechanics-smackdown/) [whether we need to supplement] [ordinary quantum mechanics] by [additional new variables], or [alternatively to imagine that] wave functions [reflect our knowledge of the world], rather than [being representations of reality]. [For purposes of this post] I’ll take the [straightforward](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/) view that quantum mechanics says that the [real world] is [best described by] a wave function, an element of Hilbert space, evolving through time. (Of course time could be emergent too … something for another day.)
(有些人认为波函数仅仅是我们对于世界的知识的一种反映，而非实在的真正表达-而 Carroll 则认为，真实世界即空间就是由波函数完全描述的，时间同样由之涌现)
    - Here’s the thing: we can [construct a Hilbert space by] [starting with a classical idea like] “all possible positions of a particle” and [attaching a complex number to each value], obtaining a wave function. [All the conceivable wave functions of that form] [constitute the Hilbert space] [we’re interested in]. But we don’t __have__ to do it that way. As Einstein [might have said], God doesn’t do it that way. Once we [make wave functions by] [quantizing some classical system](((8qDQAika9))), we have states that [live in Hilbert space]. [At this point] [it essentially doesn’t matter] [where we came from]; now we’re in Hilbert space and we’ve left our [classical starting point] behind. Indeed, [it’s well-known that] very different [classical theories] [lead to the same theory] [when we quantize them], and likewise some [quantum theories] [don’t have classical predecessors at all]. #[[phys/pt10-100]]
(一旦我们通过量子化某个经典系统从而构建出了一个波函数，我们就此进入了希尔伯特空间之中，那个经典系统原本的我们所熟悉的三维空间就不再重要了，原本的三维空间与构建出的希尔伯特空间不存在一一对应的关系)
210627-12:25
        - The [[real world]] simply is quantum-mechanical [from the start]; it’s not [a quantization of some classical system]. The universe is described by an element of Hilbert space. All of our [usual classical notions] [should be derived from that], not the other way around. Even space itself. We think of the space through which we move as one of [the most basic and irreducible constituents] of the real world, [but it might be better thought of] as [an approximate notion that emerges](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/11/10/against-space/) [at large distances] and [low energies].
(然而现实世界本质上就是量子化的，不存在原本的某个经典系统这种表述，反倒是一切经典的概念都是从希尔伯特空间中推导出来的-我们通常认为空间是现实世界最基本的不可分的组成元素之一，然而，空间更可能是在大尺度和低能条件下涌现出的一个近似概念)
210627-12:42
    - [So here is the task] [we set for ourselves]: start with [a quantum state in Hilbert space]. Not [a random or generic state], admittedly; a particular kind of state. Divide Hilbert space up into pieces — technically, [factors that we multiply together to] [make the whole space]. Use quantum information — in particular, the amount of [[quantum entanglement]] [between different parts of the state], as measured by the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) — to define a “distance” between them. [Parts that are highly entangled] [are considered to be nearby], while [unentangled parts] are far away. This gives us a graph, in which [[vertices]] are the [different parts] of Hilbert space, and [the edges are weighted by] the [emergent distance] between them. #[[mutual information]]
        - ![](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/rc-graph.jpg)
        - We can then ask two questions:
            - When we zoom out, does the graph [take on the geometry of] a smooth, [flat space] [with a fixed number of dimensions]? (Answer: yes, when we [put in the right kind of state to start with].)
            - If we [perturb the state a little bit], how does the [emergent geometry] change? (Answer: [space curves] [in response to emergent mass/energy], [in a way reminiscent of] [Einstein’s equation in general relativity].)
(涌现出的几何构造-施加能量扰动后，如何变形-这样看来，时空曲率似乎并不难以获得)
        - It’s that last bit that is most exciting, but also most speculative. The claim, in its most dramatic-sounding form, is that gravity ([[spacetime curvature]] caused by energy/momentum) [isn’t hard to obtain] [in quantum mechanics] — it’s automatic! Or at least, [the most natural thing] to expect. If geometry is defined by entanglement and quantum information, then [perturbing the state](((Z5_VJUAOq))) (e.g. by adding energy) [naturally changes that geometry]. And [if the model matches onto] an [emergent field theory] [at large distances], [the most natural relationship between] energy and curvature is given by [Einstein’s equation]. [The optimistic view is that] gravity [just pops out effortlessly] [in the classical limit of] [an appropriate quantum system]. But the devil is in the details, and [there’s a long way to go] [before we can declare victory].
210627-16:32
- Here’s the abstract for our paper:
    - [Space from Hilbert Space: Recovering Geometry from Bulk Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08444)
    - __ChunJun Cao, Sean M. Carroll, Spyridon Michalakis__
    - We examine [how to construct] a [[spatial manifold]] and its geometry from the [[entanglement structure]] of [an abstract quantum state] [in Hilbert space]. Given a decomposition of Hilbert space __H__ into a [[tensor product]] of factors, we consider a class of “[[redundancy-constrained state]]s” in __H__ that [generalize](((GAvQgjvhW))) the [[area-law behavior]] for [[entanglement entropy]] usually found in [[condensed-matter system]]s with [[gapped local Hamiltonian]]s. Using mutual information to define a [[distance measure]] [on the graph], we employ classical [[multidimensional scaling]] to extract the best-fit [[spatial dimensionality]] of the [[emergent geometry]]. 
210627-18:55
        - [We then show that] [[entanglement perturbation]]s on such [emergent geometries] [naturally give rise to] [[local modification]]s of [spatial curvature] which [obey a (spatial) analog of] [[Einstein’s equation]]. [The Hilbert space corresponding to] [a region of flat space] is finite-dimensional and [scales as the volume](((M7oYvwWX6))), though the entropy (and the maximum change thereof) [scales like] [the area of the boundary](((OsJEFXYP2))). A version of the [[ER=EPR]] conjecture is recovered, in that perturbations that [entangle distant parts of the emergent geometry] [generate a configuration] that [may be considered as] a highly [[quantum wormhole]].
(希尔伯特空间的尺度成比例于所对应的有限维空间的体积，纠缠熵则成比例于边界的面积)
210627-21:53
- Like almost any [physics paper], we’re [building on ideas that have come before]. The idea that [spacetime geometry is related to entanglement](https://inspirehep.net/record/1295886?ln=en) [has become increasingly popular], although [it’s mostly been explored in] the [holographic context](((1UK6DM_42))) of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]; [here we’re working directly in] [the “bulk” region of space], not appealing to [a faraway boundary]. [A related notion] is the [ER=EPR](https://inspirehep.net/record/1236661?ln=en) conjecture of Maldacena and Susskind, relating entanglement to [wormholes](https://quantumfrontiers.com/2013/06/07/entanglement-wormholes/). In some sense, we’re [making this proposal] [a bit more specific], by [giving a formula for] [distance as a function of entanglement]. 
    - [The relationship of geometry to energy] [comes from something called] [the Entanglement First Law], articulated by [Faulkner et al.](https://inspirehep.net/record/1275672?ln=en), and used by [Ted Jacobson](https://inspirehep.net/record/1370675?ln=en) in a version of [entropic gravity](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/02/08/guest-post-grant-remmen-on-entropic-gravity/). But [as far as we know] [we’re the first to start directly from] Hilbert space, rather than [assuming classical variables], a boundary, or a [[background spacetime]]. ([There’s an enormous amount of work] that has been done [in closely related areas], obviously, so [I’d love to hear about anything in particular that] [we should know about].) #[[entropic gravity]]

210627-22:56
    - [We’re quick to admit that] [what we’ve done here] is [extremely preliminary and conjectural]. 非常初步的和推测的 [We don’t have] [a full theory of anything], and even [what we do] [have involves a great deal of speculating] and not yet enough [rigorous calculating].
    - Most importantly, [we’ve assumed that] [parts of Hilbert space that] are [highly entangled](((-tNN1oxOM))) are also “nearby,” but we haven’t actually [derived that fact]. It’s certainly what __should__ happen, according to our [current understanding] of [[quantum field theory]]. [It might seem like] [[entangled particles]] [can be as far apart as you like], but [the contribution of particles to the overall entanglement] is [almost completely negligible] — it’s the [[quantum vacuum]] itself that [carries almost all of the entanglement], and that’s how we [derive our geometry].
(本文的一个假设是：所关注的高度纠缠的希尔伯特空间中的部分同时是相互临近的-当然存在相距几乎无穷远但是仍然纠缠着的粒子，但其对总体量子纠缠的贡献几乎可以忽略不计-^^量子真空本身贡献了几乎全部的量子纠缠，也从而涌现出了时空几何^^)
210627-23:47, 23:55
    - [But it remains to be seen] [whether this notion really matches] [what we think of] as “distance.” To do that, [it’s not sufficient to] [talk about space], we also need to talk about time, and [how states evolve]. That’s an obvious [next step], but one [we’ve just begun to think about]. It raises a variety of [intimidating questions]. What is the [appropriate Hamiltonian] that actually [generates time evolution]? Is time [fundamental and continuous], or [emergent and discrete]? Can we derive an [[emergent theory]] that includes not only [curved space and time], but other [[quantum field]]s? Will those fields satisfy the [[relativistic condition]] of being invariant under [[Lorentz transformation]]s? Will gravity, in particular, have [[propagating degrees of freedom]] corresponding to [[spin-2 graviton]]s? (And only one kind of graviton, coupled universally to energy-momentum?) 普遍耦合 [Full employment] for the [immediate future].

    - [看到这个问题][我立刻就联想到][以前看到的] Sean Carroll 的[一篇 blog](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/07/18/space-emerging-from-quantum-mechanics/)。回去找了一下，果然找到了：
        - 这个问题，也许在10年前，会得到断然的否定。但是现在却[有了一些新的东西]，很有趣，但是也[很初步]，还属于[脑洞阶段]。
    - 严格讲，Carroll 所做的工作，和[题主的问题][并不严格一样]。[他的猜想是][时空涌现于量子纠缠]。[这里问的是][坍缩]。但是坍缩其实也是[量子纠缠的一种表象] - 如果我们接受按照[多世界-退相干的纲领]的话。
    - 关于时空结构与量子纠缠的关系，最著名的莫过于 ER=EPR 了。但是这里主要介绍一下 Carroll 的猜想。
    - 首先，前面我说，量子坍缩是量子纠缠的一种表象。[这个观点]虽然并不算是[被学界一致认同]，但是随着[退相干理论]的[日益成为共识]，这种观点也算是一种[相对主流]了。
        - 比如说，S 是一个[双态系统]，对应着它的两个态，我们[有一台观察仪器]也有两个[相应的记录状态]。在发生观察之前，[仪器的状态]是“就绪”。发生了观察之后，它的状态就变成了“记录了一种结果”。为方便计，我们把仪器的“就绪”状态记做 $$\varnothing$$，把“记录了系统状态为1”的状态记做1，把“记录了系统状态为0”的状态记做0。如果[系统一开始][处于某种本征态]，那么[仪器的观察][不会改变系统的状态]，而[相应地][其记录中]就会[产生与系统对应的状态]。
            - $$\begin{aligned}
|0\rangle_{S}|\varnothing\rangle_{A} & \Rightarrow|0\rangle_{S}|0\rangle_{A} \\
|1\rangle_{S}|\varnothing\rangle_{A} & \Rightarrow|1\rangle_{S}|1\rangle_{A}
\end{aligned}$$

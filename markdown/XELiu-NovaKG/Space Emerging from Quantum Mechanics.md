- [The other day] [I was amused to] find [a quote from Einstein](https://twitter.com/seanmcarroll/status/754357519506477056), in 1936, about [how hard it would be to] [[quantize gravity]]: “[like an attempt to] [breathe in empty space].” Eight decades later, I think we can still agree that it’s hard.

- So here is a possibility [worth considering]: rather than quantizing gravity, [maybe we should try to] [gravitize quantum mechanics](((GNyD7gLPd))). Or, [more accurately] but [less evocatively], 更准确但不那么引人入胜 “find gravity inside quantum mechanics.” Rather than starting with some [essentially classical view of gravity](((h2CUtldR0))) and “quantizing” it, [we might imagine starting with] [a quantum view of reality] [from the start], and find the [ordinary three-dimensional space] [in which we live] somehow [emerging from quantum information]. [That’s the project that] [ChunJun (Charles) Cao], Spyridon (Spiros) Michalakis, and I [take a few tentative steps toward] in [a new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08444).

- We human beings, [even those who have been] [studying quantum mechanics] [for a long time], [still think in terms of] a [classical concepts]. Positions, momenta, particles, fields, space itself. Quantum mechanics [tells a different story]. The [[quantum state]] of the universe is not [a collection of things] [distributed through space], [but something called] a [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function). The [[wave function]] [gives us a way of] [calculating the outcomes of measurements](((sCNqeIalp))): whenever we measure an [[observable quantity]] like the position or momentum or [spin of a particle], the wave function [has a value for every possible outcome], and [the probability of obtaining that outcome] [is given by the wave function squared]. Indeed, that’s typically [how we construct wave functions in practice]. Start with some [classical-sounding notion] like “the position of a particle” or “the amplitude of a field,” and [to each possible value] we [attach a complex number]. That complex number, squared, [gives us the probability of] [observing the system] [with that observed value].

    - Mathematically, wave functions are elements of a [[mathematical structure]] called [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space). That means they are vectors — we can [add quantum states together] (the origin of [superpositions]([[quantum superposition]]) in quantum mechanics) and calculate the angle (“[[dot product]]”) between them. (We’re [skipping over some technicalities here], especially regarding [[complex number]]s — see e.g. __[The Theoretical Minimum](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-Theoretical-Leonard-Susskind/dp/0465062903/)__ for more.) The word “space” in “[[Hilbert space]]” doesn’t mean [the good old three-dimensional space] [we walk through every day], or even the [four-dimensional spacetime] of relativity. [It’s just math-speak for] “a collection of things,” in this case “possible quantum states of the universe.”

    - Hilbert space is [quite an abstract thing], which can [seem at times pretty removed from] the [tangible phenomena] of [our everyday lives]. 与[我们日常生活中的][有形现象][相去甚远] This leads [some people to wonder](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/05/29/quantum-mechanics-smackdown/) [whether we need to supplement] [ordinary quantum mechanics] by [additional new variables], or [alternatively to imagine that] wave functions [reflect our knowledge of the world], rather than [being representations of reality]. [For purposes of this post] I’ll take the [straightforward](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/) view that quantum mechanics says that the [real world] is [best described by] a wave function, an element of Hilbert space, evolving through time. (Of course time could be emergent too … something for another day.)
(有些人认为波函数仅仅是我们对于世界的知识的一种反映，而非实在的真正表达-而 Carroll 则认为，真实世界即空间就是由波函数完全描述的，时间同样由之涌现)
    - Here’s the thing: we can [construct a Hilbert space by] [starting with a classical idea like] “all possible positions of a particle” and [attaching a complex number to each value], obtaining a wave function. [All the conceivable wave functions of that form] [constitute the Hilbert space] [we’re interested in]. But we don’t __have__ to do it that way. As Einstein [might have said], God doesn’t do it that way. Once we [make wave functions by] [quantizing some classical system](((8qDQAika9))), we have states that [live in Hilbert space]. [At this point] [it essentially doesn’t matter] [where we came from]; now we’re in Hilbert space and we’ve left our [classical starting point] behind. Indeed, [it’s well-known that] very different [classical theories] [lead to the same theory] [when we quantize them], and likewise some [quantum theories] [don’t have classical predecessors at all]. #[[phys/pt10-100]]
(一旦我们通过量子化某个经典系统从而构建出了一个波函数，我们就此进入了希尔伯特空间之中，那个经典系统原本的我们所熟悉的三维空间就不再重要了，原本的三维空间与构建出的希尔伯特空间不存在一一对应的关系)

        - The [[real world]] simply is quantum-mechanical [from the start]; it’s not [a quantization of some classical system]. The universe is described by an element of Hilbert space. All of our [usual classical notions] [should be derived from that], not the other way around. Even space itself. We think of the space through which we move as one of [the most basic and irreducible constituents] of the real world, [but it might be better thought of] as [an approximate notion that emerges](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/11/10/against-space/) [at large distances] and [low energies].
(然而现实世界本质上就是量子化的，不存在原本的某个经典系统这种表述，反倒是一切经典的概念都是从希尔伯特空间中推导出来的-我们通常认为空间是现实世界最基本的不可分的组成元素之一，然而，空间更可能是在大尺度和低能条件下涌现出的一个近似概念)

    - [So here is the task] [we set for ourselves]: start with [a quantum state in Hilbert space]. Not [a random or generic state], admittedly; a particular kind of state. Divide Hilbert space up into pieces — technically, [factors that we multiply together to] [make the whole space]. Use quantum information — in particular, the amount of [[quantum entanglement]] [between different parts of the state], as measured by the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) — to define a “distance” between them. Parts that are highly entangled are considered to be nearby, while unentangled parts are far away. This gives us a graph, in which vertices are the different parts of Hilbert space, and the edges are weighted by the emergent distance between them. #[[mutual information]]

    - [看到这个问题][我立刻就联想到][以前看到的] Sean Carroll 的[一篇 blog](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/07/18/space-emerging-from-quantum-mechanics/)。回去找了一下，果然找到了：
        - 这个问题，也许在10年前，会得到断然的否定。但是现在却[有了一些新的东西]，很有趣，但是也[很初步]，还属于[脑洞阶段]。
    - 严格讲，Carroll 所做的工作，和[题主的问题][并不严格一样]。[他的猜想是][时空涌现于量子纠缠]。[这里问的是][坍缩]。但是坍缩其实也是[量子纠缠的一种表象] - 如果我们接受按照[多世界-退相干的纲领]的话。
    - 关于时空结构与量子纠缠的关系，最著名的莫过于 ER=EPR 了。但是这里主要介绍一下 Carroll 的猜想。
    - 首先，前面我说，量子坍缩是量子纠缠的一种表象。[这个观点]虽然并不算是[被学界一致认同]，但是随着[退相干理论]的[日益成为共识]，这种观点也算是一种[相对主流]了。
        - 比如说，S 是一个[双态系统]，对应着它的两个态，我们[有一台观察仪器]也有两个[相应的记录状态]。在发生观察之前，[仪器的状态]是“就绪”。发生了观察之后，它的状态就变成了“记录了一种结果”。为方便计，我们把仪器的“就绪”状态记做 $$\varnothing$$，把“记录了系统状态为1”的状态记做1，把“记录了系统状态为0”的状态记做0。如果[系统一开始][处于某种本征态]，那么[仪器的观察][不会改变系统的状态]，而[相应地][其记录中]就会[产生与系统对应的状态]。
            - $$\begin{aligned}
|0\rangle_{S}|\varnothing\rangle_{A} & \Rightarrow|0\rangle_{S}|0\rangle_{A} \\
|1\rangle_{S}|\varnothing\rangle_{A} & \Rightarrow|1\rangle_{S}|1\rangle_{A}
\end{aligned}$$

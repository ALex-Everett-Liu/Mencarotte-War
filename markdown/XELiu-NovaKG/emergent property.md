- An [[emergent behavior]] or [emergent property] can appear when a number of [simple entities]([[entity]]) ([[agent]]s) [operate in an environment], forming more [[complex behavior]]s as a [[collective]].
- If emergence happens over [disparate size scales], 发生在不同大小的尺度上 then the reason is usually a [[causal relation]] [across different scales](((a4lut-b0R))).
    - In other words, there is often a form of [[top-down feedback]] in systems with emergent properties.
    - Emergent behaviours can occur because of [intricate causal relations](((Gp4OnHV2M))) 错综复杂的因果关系 across different scales and feedback, known as [[interconnectivity]].

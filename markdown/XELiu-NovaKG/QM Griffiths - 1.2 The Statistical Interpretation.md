- But what exactly is this “wave function,” and what does it do for you [once you’ve got it]? After all, a [[particle]], by its nature, is [localized at a point](((1OEniqfOu))), whereas the [[wave function]] (as its name suggests) is [spread out in space](((U24HzqPt5))) (it’s a function of x, for any given t). How can [such an object] [represent the state of a particle]? 
(粒子-定域在某一点处；波-弥散在空间中)
    - The answer is provided by [Born’s statistical interpretation](((ofW5-difs))), which says that $$|\Psi(x, t)|^{2}$$ gives [the probability of finding the particle](((pS8u7ULkU))) at point x, at time t—or, more precisely,[3]
$$\int_{a}^{b}|\Psi(x, t)|^{2} d x=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\text { probability of finding the particle } \\
\text { between } a \text { and } b, \text { at time } t .
\end{array}\right\}$$   (1.3)
        - Probability is the area under the graph of $$\left| \Psi \right|^2$$. For the wave function in Figure 1.2, you [would be quite likely to] [find the particle] [in the vicinity of] point A, where $$\left| \Psi \right|^2$$ is large, and [relatively unlikely to] find it near point B.
(统计诠释-在某时刻某位置处发现某个粒子的概率)
        - Figure 1.2: A typical wave function. The [shaded area] represents [the probability of finding the particle] between a and b. The particle would be relatively likely to be found near A, and unlikely to be found near B.
        - [3]: The wave function itself is complex, but $$|\Psi|^{2}=\Psi^{*} \Psi$$ (where $$\Psi^{*}$$ is the [[complex conjugate]] of Psi) is real and [[non-negative]]—as a [[probability]], of course, must be.
- The statistical interpretation introduces a kind of [[indeterminacy]] into quantum mechanics, for [even if you know everything] [the theory has to tell you] about the particle ([to wit]: its wave function), still you cannot [predict with certainty the outcome of](((7ZoP-gUlu))) [a simple experiment] to [measure its position]—all quantum mechanics has to offer is [[statistical information]] about the [possible results](((vK2D2Dgch))). This indeterminacy has been [profoundly disturbing to] physicists and philosophers alike, and [it is natural to wonder] whether it is [a fact of nature](((VC9F4aeHd))), or [a defect in the theory](((M84mgmRmh))).
(统计诠释的不确定性-做一个试图测量粒子位置的实验，无法得到精确结果，只能得到统计信息)
    - Suppose I do [measure the position of the particle], and I find it to be at point C.[4] Question: [Where was the particle] [just before I made the measurement]([[measurement]])? There are three [plausible answers] to this question, and they [serve to characterize] the [main schools of thought] regarding [[quantum indeterminacy]]:
(测量该粒子位置之前的那一刻，该粒子处于怎样的状态中？)
        - [4]: Of course, no [measuring instrument](((Mf4v9xiUt))) is [perfectly precise]; [what I mean is that] the particle was found [in the vicinity of C](((afmjgIxLt))), as defined by [the precision of the equipment](((6TpzWWvh-))).
        - 1. The [realist position](((uuuf2gELQ))): The particle was at C. This certainly seems reasonable, and it is the response Einstein advocated. Note, however, that if this is true then quantum mechanics is an [incomplete theory](((Jvpb8miNt))), since the particle really was at C, and yet quantum mechanics was [unable to tell us so]. To the realist, indeterminacy is not a fact of nature, but [a reflection of our ignorance](((gsdUMUn1m))). As d’Espagnat put it, “[the position of the particle] was never indeterminate, but was merely unknown to the experimenter.” 5 Evidently Psi is [not the whole story]—some [additional information](((UwWAAnKNa))) (known as a [[hidden variable]]) is needed to provide [a complete description of](((lKKCqteVB))) the particle.
(实在论-量子力学不完备-波函数并非全部的故事/并没有包含粒子状态的全部信息-存在未知的信息-隐变量)
            - [5]: Bernard d’Espagnat, “The Quantum Theory and Reality” ([[Scientific American]], November 1979, p. 165).
        - 2. The [orthodox position](((op9ZUg4HR))): The particle wasn’t really anywhere. It was the [act of measurement](((GmVCaGX7A))) that forced it to “take a stand” (though how and why it decided on the point C [we dare not ask]). Jordan said it most starkly: “[Observations]([[observation]]) not only [disturb what is to be measured], they produce it …We compel [the particle] to [assume a definite position](((xCkXJ-pgy))).” 6 This view (the so-called [[Copenhagen interpretation]]), is associated with Bohr and his followers. Among physicists it has always been [the most widely accepted position]. Note, however, that [if it is correct] there is something very peculiar about the act of measurement—something that [almost a century of debate has done] precious little to illuminate.

- **Example 1.1
Electron Interference.** [I have asserted that] particles (electrons, for example) have a [[wave nature]], [encoded](((D_5CGNDP0))) in Psi. How might we check this, in the laboratory? #[[electron interference]]
    - The [classic signature](((qQjPYFN_T))) of a [[wave phenomenon]] is [[interference]]: two waves [[in phase]] [[interfere constructively]], and [[out of phase]] they [[interfere destructively]]. The [[wave nature of light]] was confirmed in 1801 by Young’s famous [[double-slit experiment]], showing [interference “fringes”](((kN2H3900C))) on a [distant screen](((j0VNhIQ05))) when a [[monochromatic beam]] [passes through two slits]. If [essentially the same experiment] is done with electrons, [the same pattern develops](((7BhAHdmDz))),[10] confirming the wave nature of electrons.

        - [10]: Because [the wavelength of electrons] is typically very small, the slits have to be [extremely close together]. Historically, this was first achieved by Davisson and Germer, in 1925, using the [atomic layers in a crystal] as “slits.” For [an interesting account], see R. K. Gehrenbeck, __Physics Today__, January 1978, page 34.

- But what exactly is this “wave function,” and what does it do for you [once you’ve got it]? After all, a [[particle]], by its nature, is [localized at a point](((1OEniqfOu))), whereas the [[wave function]] (as its name suggests) is [spread out in space](((U24HzqPt5))) (it’s a function of x, for any given t). How can [such an object] [represent the state of a particle]?

    - The answer is provided by [Born’s statistical interpretation](((ofW5-difs))), which says that $$|\Psi(x, t)|^{2}$$ gives [the probability of finding the particle](((pS8u7ULkU))) at point x, at time t—or, more precisely,[3]
$$\int_{a}^{b}|\Psi(x, t)|^{2} d x=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\text { probability of finding the particle } \\
\text { between } a \text { and } b, \text { at time } t .
\end{array}\right\}$$   (1.3)
        - Probability is the area under the graph of $$\left| \Psi \right|^2$$. For the wave function in Figure 1.2, you [would be quite likely to] [find the particle] [in the vicinity of] point A, where $$\left| \Psi \right|^2$$ is large, and [relatively unlikely to] find it near point B.

        - Figure 1.2: A typical wave function. The [shaded area] represents [the probability of finding the particle] between a and b. The particle would be relatively likely to be found near A, and unlikely to be found near B.
        - [3]: The wave function itself is complex, but $$|\Psi|^{2}=\Psi^{*} \Psi$$ (where $$\Psi^{*}$$ is the [[complex conjugate]] of Psi) is real and [[non-negative]]—as a [[probability]], of course, must be.

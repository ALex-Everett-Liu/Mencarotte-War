- An essential aspect of a traveling wave is that it is a self- sustaining disturbance of the medium through which it propagates. The most familiar waves, and the easiest to visualize (Fig. 2.1), are the mechanical waves, among which are waves on strings, surface waves on liquids, sound waves in the air, and compression waves in both solids and fluids. Sound waves are longitudinal—the medium is displaced in the direction of motion of the wave. Waves on a string (and electromagnetic waves) are transverse—the medium is displaced in a direction perpendicular to that of the motion of the wave. In all cases, although the energy-carrying disturbance advances through the medium, the individual participating atoms remain in the vicinity of their equilibrium positions: the disturbance advances, not the material medium. That’s one of several crucial features of a wave that distinguishes it from a stream of particles. The wind blowing across a field sets up “waves of grain” that sweep by, even though each stalk only sways in place. Leonardo da Vinci seems to have been the first person to recognize that a wave does not transport the medium through which it travels, and it is precisely this property that allows waves to propagate at very great speeds.

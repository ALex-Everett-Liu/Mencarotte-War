- Imagine a particle of mass m, constrained to move along the x axis, subject to some specified force (Figure 1.1). The program of classical mechanics is to determine the position of the particle at any given time: . Once we know that, we can figure out the velocity , the momentum , the kinetic energy , or any other dynamical variable of interest. And how do we go about determining ? We apply Newtonâ€™s second law: .

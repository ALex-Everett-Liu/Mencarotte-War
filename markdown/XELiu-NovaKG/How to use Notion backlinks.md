- [Note-taking] and [personal knowledge management] are [in the midst of] a [[technological revolution]]. 正置身于一场技术革命之中 [Gone are the days of] an [Evernote] [[text file]], replaced by [databases](https://radreads.co/notion-databases/), [interactive templates](https://radreads.co/notion-templates/) and [[Excel-like]] [formulas](https://radreads.co/notion-formulas/). #[[interactive template]] #formula
    - You know what else [has gotten a facelift]? The good old [[hyperlink]]s is [a relic of the past]. Taking its place are [[backlink]]s and [[bi-directional link]]s. This guide [covers everything you need to know] about [[Note-taking/Notion]] backlinks [beginning with their history] and ending with [how to use them].

- ## Introduction Notion Backlinks
    - Notion is an [all-purpose productivity app](https://radreads.co/notion/) that [launched in] june 2018 and armed with a $50 mm [war chest of cash] (from [an eye-popping $2 Bn valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/) [in the midst of COVID]) the company’s been [growing its feature set] like wildfire. 
        - war chest: 专用款项
    - And in an [[adjacent sphere]] of [note-taking apps], [Roam Research](http://roamresearch.com/) is leading its own [[innovation]] of **“networked thought”** (alongside [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [MyMind](https://mymind.com/) and [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)). #[[Roam Research]] #[[Note-taking/Obsidian]] #TiddlyWiki #MyMind
        - These apps have popularized the bi-directional link. [[Nat Eliason]] called backlinks [Roam’s “best feature”](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam): #blog
            - __This is the [best feature] I’ve found for [discovering new relationships] between information.__ It [makes it so easy to] [tie pages together], and to help you [get better organized]([[organized]]). 
    - And in September 2020, Notion quietly [jumped into the fray] as the [[Twittersphere]] saw backlinks [pop up at the top of their pages]. (Notion’s [official announcement](https://www.notion.so/What-s-New-157765353f2c4705bd45474e5ba8b46c) page [makes no mention of it].) #[[announcement]]

- ## What are backlinks?
    - Many of us (myself included) [never thought much about] hyperlinks. We know [they’re blue and clickable]([[clickable]]). And that if you [want to return to] your [[previous page]], you just __hit the [back button]__.
    - In [[Maggie Appleton]]’s [short history of bi-directional links](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) she explains how this [classic link] (known as the [mono-link]) is “a [[one way pointer]]” that doesn’t retain any of the [[context]] from the [[referring page]].

        - Conversely, the backlink or [bi-directional links] has “[[social awareness]]:”
            - __It [knows about other pages] or ‘nodes’ that [point to it], and can [make them visible to people].__ This means we get a [[two-way conversation]] flowing between our [[web location]]s.
    - Here’s [my explanation] of backlinks: #iframe

    - And as you build your [[knowledge graph]] of notes, books, resources and tasks – the backlink [exponentially grows]([[exponential growth]]) the [[serendipity]] within your [[digital workspace]]s. 
- ## How to use Notion Backlinks
    - It looks like using Notion Backlinks is [easy as pie]. You don’t have to do anything. **Backlinks are [created automatically]** . You’ll just see a little [[indicator]] [on the top left of any page] that shows that __[other pages link to it]__. 
        - If you [expand that icon], you’ll see the pages that were **@mentioned** or **linked to** (in clickable fashion). #[[mentioned]]
    - TBH, [there’s probably a reason] this is a [quiet release] – it doesn’t [move the needle] much (and some [Notion Pros agreed](https://twitter.com/aNotioneer/status/1301478546792214528)). Notion is probably [laying a foundation for] [more powerful] backlinks, but for now you can’t even begin to [compare this feature to] [Roam Research].
**Notion 实在是令人作呕 !!!**
- ## Notion “Global” Blocks are still [way more powerful]
    - In fact, [one of the most powerful] [linking feature] [isn’t widely known]: **Global Blocks**. This [undiscovered feature] is probably by design, since it’s unofficial (like the numerous [Notion integrations](https://radreads.co/notion-integrations/) using the “[unofficial API]([[API]])”).
    - This [[workaround]]s enables [transclusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/gvbg1q/what_is_block_level_transclusion_and_why_is_it/): lets you [reuse an entire block] (a [[footer]], for example) so that [[edits in one place]] will [automatically pass through to the other blocks]. Here’s a [quick tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQW1retgBcA) on [[global block]]s: #Reddit #[[Roam Research]] #transclusion #[[block level]]

    - But like anything __unofficial__, buyer beware.

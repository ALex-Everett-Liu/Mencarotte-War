- During most of the [[Joseon Dynasty (李氏朝鲜王朝)]], Korea was divided into eight provinces (do; 도; 道). The eight provinces' boundaries [remained unchanged] for about 480 years from 1413 to 1895, and formed a [[geographic paradigm]] that is still reflected today in the [[Korean Peninsula]]'s [[administrative division]]s, [[dialect]]s, and [[regional distinction]]s. The names of all eight provinces [are still preserved today], in one form or another. These eight [historical provinces] [form both North and South Korea], and are [not to be confused with] the current eight provinces that [make up South Korea].

- The electric dipole moment is [a measure of the separation of] [positive and negative electrical charges] [within a system], that is, a measure of the system's overall [[polarity]]. The [SI unit]([[International System of Units (SI)]]) for electric dipole moment is the [coulomb-meter (Câ‹…m)]. The [[debye (D)]] is another unit of measurement used in [atomic physics and chemistry].

    - Theoretically, an electric dipole is defined by the first-order term of the multipole expansion; it consists of two equal and opposite charges that are infinitesimally close together, although real dipoles have separated charge.[1]

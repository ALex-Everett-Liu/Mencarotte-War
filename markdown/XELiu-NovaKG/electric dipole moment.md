- The electric dipole moment is [a measure of the separation of] [positive and negative electrical charges] [within a system], that is, a measure of the system's overall [[polarity]]. The [SI unit]([[International System of Units (SI)]]) for electric dipole moment is the [coulomb-meter (Câ‹…m)]. The [[debye (D)]] is another unit of measurement used in [atomic physics and chemistry].

    - Theoretically, an [[electric dipole]] is defined by the [[first-order term]] of the [[multipole expansion]]; it consists of [two equal and opposite charges] that are [infinitesimally close together], although [real dipoles] have [separated charge].[1]

    - The electric field due to a [[point dipole]] (upper left), a physical dipole of electric charges (upper right), a thin [[polarized sheet]] (lower left) or a [[plate capacitor]] (lower right). All generate the same [[field profile]] [when the arrangement is infinitesimally small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_dipoles_electric.svg).

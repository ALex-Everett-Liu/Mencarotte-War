- The electric dipole moment is [a measure of the separation of] [positive and negative electrical charges] [within a system], that is, a measure of the system's overall [[polarity]]. The [SI unit]([[International System of Units (SI)]]) for electric dipole moment is the [coulomb-meter (Câ‹…m)]. The [[debye (D)]] is another unit of measurement used in [atomic physics and chemistry].

    - Theoretically, an [[electric dipole]] is defined by the [[first-order term]] of the [[multipole expansion]]; it consists of [two equal and opposite charges] that are [infinitesimally close together], although [real dipoles] have [separated charge].[1]

    - The electric field due to a [[point dipole]] (upper left), a physical dipole of electric charges (upper right), a thin [[polarized sheet]] (lower left) or a [[plate capacitor]] (lower right). All generate the same [[field profile]] [when the arrangement is infinitesimally small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_dipoles_electric.svg).

        - [Computed drawings]([[drawing]]) of [four different types of] electric dipoles.
        - Upper left: An ideal [point-like dipole]. The [field shape](((8xQXKhp0I))) is [scale invariant](((u8-C5qggz))) and [approximates the field of] any [charge configuration] [with nonzero dipole moment] [at large distance].

        - Upper right: [Discrete dipole] of [two opposite point charges]([[point charge]]) [at finite distance], a physical dipole.
        - Lower left: Thin round disc with uniform electric polarization along the symmetry axis.
        - Lower right: Plate capacitor with uniformly charged circular discs.
        - Although the four field configurations differ significantly, they all converge to the same dipole field at large distances. Each configuration may represent an electric dipole.

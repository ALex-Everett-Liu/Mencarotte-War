- Quantum computing is the [biggest revolution] in computing since… computing. Our world is made of [[quantum information]], but we [perceive the world] in [[classical information]]. That is, [there is a whole lot going on] [at small scales] that are [not accessible with] our [normal senses]. [As humans we evolved to] [process classical information], not quantum information: [our brains are wired to think about] [Sabertooth cats], not [Schrodinger’s cats]. We can [encode our classical information] easily enough [with zeros and ones], but what about [accessing the extra information available] that [makes up our universe]? Can we use the [quantum nature of reality] to [[process information]]? Of course, [otherwise we would have to] [end this post here] and [that would be unsatisfying to us all]. [Let’s explore the power of] [[quantum computing]] [then get you started] writing some of your own [quantum code].

    - 量子计算是自[计算机技术]出现 “计算” 以来[最大的革命]。[我们的世界]是由 [量子信息](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information) 构成的，但我们却是在[经典信息](https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/classical-information)中[感知世界]的。也就是说，[在小范围内][有很多事情]是我们[正常的感官][所无法感知的]。作为人类，[我们进化到][只能处理经典信息]，而不是[量子信息]：[我们的大脑][天生能思考] [Sabertooth cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber-toothed_cat)，而不是 [Schrodinger’s cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat)。 #pt10-99.99
        - 我们可以[很容易地]用 0 和 1 来[编码我们的经典信息]，但是如何访问[组成我们宇宙的][额外信息]呢？我们能利用[现实的量子特性]来[处理信息]吗？当然，否则我们将[不得不在这里就][结束这篇文章]了，这不会让我们满足的。接下来，让我们来探索[量子计算的威力]，然后让你[开始写一些][量子代码](https://www.yuque.com/lucky/blog/rxbnte)。
- The jumping off point for exploring quantum computing is to understand that while many of the principles are counterintuitive, the classical universe we know and love is but a mere shadow of the quantum fabric of reality. Part of [becoming comfortable with] the quantum is to become comfortable with [the limitations of our own perception](((eHOX7LFr0))). This limitation is analogous to [drawing a 3D object] [on a 2D sheet of paper]. [Take a look at] the wireframe below. [It can represent] either a box ([we can illustrate this] [with a glass on top]) or [it can be inverted into] a corner (we can [put the bottle inside] to make it flip to a corner [in our brains]).
    - [We are forced to see] [either one or the other] and [never both]. We can [change them back and forth], but because we are [stuck in a two dimensional representation] [we can only see one or the other]. Two dimensions is not enough for a [perfect representation] of [a three dimensional object]. Similarly the world of classical information in its [simplest encoding] is [represented in bits], 0s and 1s. [These are not enough though to] describe the [[quantum world]]. In the quantum world, we need [[quantum bit]]s, or [[qubit]]s, to [describe our information]. Like [putting the drink on top of the box] or [in the corner], we can [make a measurement] that will [force our qubit to tell us] a [[classical bit]], but [there is more information there] [that we can take advantage of].

- [Quantum computers]([[quantum computer]]) will [use the rest of the information to] [achieve more computational power]. [This will be transformative with applications in] pharma, green new materials, logistics, finance, [big data] and more. For example, quantum computing [will be better at] [calculating the energy of molecules](((evYbUmoMf))) because this is a [fundamentally quantum problem]. [So if you can imagine] [an industry that deals with molecules], you can imagine an application of quantum computing. [Often people want to know] if quantum computers will be faster, and while [they will be able to] [do computations faster], [it is not because] they are [doing the same thing] [with more cycles]. Instead quantum computers take advantage of [a fundamentally different way of] [processing information]. To get a feel for that fundamental difference we will walk through an example that helps to illustrate the power of quantum computation.

- ## Meet a quantum drunk
    - We are going to think about the drunken walk. In the classical [[drunken walk]] (sometimes called the [[random walk]]) we have a drunk who is [leaving the restroom] and [trying to find his friend] [at the bar].
        - [Everyone basically looks the same] [at this hipster bar] and he has had one too many so he is [approaching a random person] [seated at the bar]. [When he discovers that] [the first person he has bothered] [is not his friend], he will [randomly go to] the next stool, either to the left or to the right. We can simulate our drunken walker by [flipping a coin and saying heads](((1OSvMn31p))) he will go right, tails he will go left.
210625-22:40
        - [The next person] is also wrong and [his memory is short], so they will [move on to either the left or right] [with equal probability]. [This will go on until] [security is called] to [throw out the drunkard].
        - The [security team] [loves physics], so they decide to [keep a tally of] where they finally [catch up to the drunk] each time. Here is what security finds:
            - ![](https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Stack_04.gif)
            - The shape is a [[bell curve]], and the [interesting feature] of the bell curve is that [the spread of the middle] ([the most likely place to] [find the drunk]) is the square root of [the number of steps the drunken walker takes]. When the drunk tries nine barstools, [the spread of the bell curve](((ZEtrzJqks))) is three; security [can likely find them within] three barstools of where they started. When the drunk [makes 100 attempts], security will find the most likely within the ten [closest stools] [to where they started]. These statistics help security know where they are most likely to find the drunken walker, who is somewhere [near the center].
210625-22:50
                - ![](https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Stack_05.png)
    - Now the security team [has a model they can use to] keep up with the [classical drunks], but unfortunately at this bar there are also [quantum drunks]. Whereas the classical drunk is [a simple coin flip for each direction], for the quantum drunk [the coin is quantum], and can be [in a superposition of heads and tails](((c3HTcQ4kP))) [at the same time]. The quantum drunk is [following a path that] is [a superposition of left and right](((c3HTcQ4kP))) [at each bar stool]. 
210625-23:03
        - Superposition is one of the [fundamental concepts] in quantum mechanics and [one of the tools that] differentiates quantum information and classical information. [The treatment here] is [limited by necessity]; [for more fun with] superpositions, check out this Strangeworks post on some of the [fundamentals of qubits](https://quantumcomputing.com/strangeworks/play-with-one-qubit?source=stackoverflow).
    - The quantum drunk will go in [a superposition of left and right simultaneously] with no [[definite position]] [until security finds them].
        - When the security looks at [the distribution of positions] [where the quantum drunk is found], [they will find a very different result from] the classical drunk.
        - [As opposed to] [a smooth bell curve distribution], they will find the “fangs” distribution [shown below]:
            - ![](https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Stack_07.gif)
            - ![](https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Stack_08.png)
            - What is going on? Where is the quantum drunk? Why would [the peaks of the distribution] [be on the outside]? Why are there [areas inside] that are [very low probability] and [others that are higher]? The quantum drunk [has new properties].
210626-08:54
            - The drunkard [tends to be farther away], and [it is less likely to] be [close to the center]. [Certain paths] are [less probable] because of [[interference]], while some are [more probable]. [The overall spread] is much different too. Instead of the spread being [related to the square root], the spread is [related linearly to] [the number or steps]. A quantum drunk taking ten steps will most likely be found on the outside of a ten barstool spread, as wide as the distribution for a classical drunk [taking 100 steps].
    - So how can we [use this to our advantage]? Is there some problem we can solve better with quantum drunks than with classical drunks? Well I’m glad you asked, because yes there is! [To see this] [we are going to] put the drunks to the task of [solving a labyrinth]([[labyrinth]]). We are [choosing a specific labyrinth] that will [illustrate the power of] the quantum drunk. [In this problem] we have a [[tree structure]] that is [mirrored and then stuck together]. 粘在一起

        - ![](https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Stack_10.gif)
        - [On the left] is [the entrance to the labyrinth] and [on the right is the exit]. [We want to see] how well our drunk walkers can [find the exit]. [Remember that] the classical drunk is going to be [flipping a coin] [at every node], whereas the quantum drunk is [creating a superposition of every path] [at each node]. The drunks tend to [get stuck in] the [random connections] [in the middle], [taking more time to] [find their way out].
210626-10:15
        - Since quantum drunks are [more spread out], they can [escape being stuck easier]. This is why quantum drunks [find the exit] faster than classical drunks.
            - ![](https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Stack_11.gif)
            - [For this problem] [as we send more and more drunks through], the quantum ones are going to make it through **exponentially** more than the classical ones!
            - [This is the power of] quantum computing. Even though this is [a simple example], all [[quantum algorithm]]s [work the same way]: by [exploiting the quantum spread](((Xa4ZAK00v))) [in clever ways] that [fit the structure of a problem]. [There are many applications for] [quantum algorithms], so [it is an exciting time to] start exploring [[quantum programming]].
210626-11:35
            - In the near term, the best applications are the design of pharmaceuticals and the engineering of new materials. Many of these chemistry applications are fundamentally quantum mechanical. This is because figuring out the energies of electrons for different molecules is more efficient using a quantum computer. Optimization problems are another area where quantum computing will have an impact in the not-too-distant future. This class of logistics problems include storage optimization (hey FedEx, call us) or the distribution of goods, such as vaccines. Risk management for finance can be tackled using similar algorithms. Further afield are the technologies to build a quantum internet that will replace some of our cryptographic systems, to ensure privacy and security.

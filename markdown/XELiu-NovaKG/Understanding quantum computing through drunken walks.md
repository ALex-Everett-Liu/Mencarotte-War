    - The [jumping off point] for [exploring quantum computing] is to understand that while [many of the principles are counterintuitive], [the classical universe we know] and love [is but a mere shadow of] the [quantum fabric of reality]. [To get a feel for] that [fundamental difference] [we will walk through an example] that [helps to illustrate the power of] [[quantum computation]].
- Quantum computing is the [biggest revolution] in computing since… computing. Our world is made of [[quantum information]], but we [perceive the world] in [[classical information]]. That is, [there is a whole lot going on] [at small scales] that are [not accessible with] our [normal senses]. [As humans we evolved to] [process classical information], not quantum information: [our brains are wired to think about] [Sabertooth cats], not [Schrodinger’s cats]. We can [encode our classical information] easily enough [with zeros and ones], but what about [accessing the extra information available] that [makes up our universe]? Can we use the [quantum nature of reality] to [[process information]]? Of course, [otherwise we would have to] [end this post here] and [that would be unsatisfying to us all]. [Let’s explore the power of] [[quantum computing]] [then get you started] writing some of your own [quantum code].

    - 量子计算是自[计算机技术]出现 “计算” 以来[最大的革命]。[我们的世界]是由 [量子信息](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information) 构成的，但我们却是在[经典信息](https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/classical-information)中[感知世界]的。也就是说，[在小范围内][有很多事情]是我们[正常的感官][所无法感知的]。作为人类，[我们进化到][只能处理经典信息]，而不是[量子信息]：[我们的大脑][天生能思考] [Sabertooth cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber-toothed_cat)，而不是 [Schrodinger’s cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat)。 #pt10-99.99
        - 我们可以[很容易地]用 0 和 1 来[编码我们的经典信息]，但是如何访问[组成我们宇宙的][额外信息]呢？我们能利用[现实的量子特性]来[处理信息]吗？当然，否则我们将[不得不在这里就][结束这篇文章]了，这不会让我们满足的。接下来，让我们来探索[量子计算的威力]，然后让你[开始写一些][量子代码](https://www.yuque.com/lucky/blog/rxbnte)。
- The jumping off point for exploring quantum computing is to understand that while many of the principles are counterintuitive, the classical universe we know and love is but a mere shadow of the quantum fabric of reality. Part of [becoming comfortable with] the quantum is to become comfortable with [the limitations of our own perception]. This limitation is analogous to [drawing a 3D object] [on a 2D sheet of paper]. Take a look at the wireframe below. It can represent either a box (we can illustrate this with a glass on top) or it can be inverted into a corner (we can put the bottle inside to make it flip to a corner in our brains).

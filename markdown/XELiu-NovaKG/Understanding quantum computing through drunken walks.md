    - The [jumping off point] for [exploring quantum computing] is to understand that while [many of the principles are counterintuitive], [the classical universe we know] and love [is but a mere shadow of] the [quantum fabric of reality]. [To get a feel for] that [fundamental difference] [we will walk through an example] that [helps to illustrate the power of] [[quantum computation]].
- Quantum computing is the [biggest revolution] in computing since… computing. Our world is made of [[quantum information]], but we [perceive the world] in [[classical information]]. That is, [there is a whole lot going on] [at small scales] that are [not accessible with] our [normal senses]. [As humans we evolved to] [process classical information], not quantum information: [our brains are wired to think about] [Sabertooth cats], not [Schrodinger’s cats]. We can [encode our classical information] easily enough [with zeros and ones], but what about [accessing the extra information available] that [makes up our universe]? Can we use the [quantum nature of reality] to [[process information]]? Of course, [otherwise we would have to] [end this post here] and [that would be unsatisfying to us all]. [Let’s explore the power of] [[quantum computing]] [then get you started] writing some of your own [quantum code].

    - 量子计算是自[计算机技术]出现 “计算” 以来[最大的革命]。[我们的世界]是由 [量子信息](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information) 构成的，但我们却是在[经典信息](https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/classical-information)中[感知世界]的。也就是说，[在小范围内][有很多事情]是我们[正常的感官][所无法感知的]。作为人类，[我们进化到][只能处理经典信息]，而不是[量子信息]：[我们的大脑][天生能思考] [Sabertooth cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber-toothed_cat)，而不是 [Schrodinger’s cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat)。 #pt10-99.99
        - 我们可以[很容易地]用 0 和 1 来[编码我们的经典信息]，但是如何访问[组成我们宇宙的][额外信息]呢？我们能利用[现实的量子特性]来[处理信息]吗？当然，否则我们将[不得不在这里就][结束这篇文章]了，这不会让我们满足的。接下来，让我们来探索[量子计算的威力]，然后让你[开始写一些][量子代码](https://www.yuque.com/lucky/blog/rxbnte)。
- The jumping off point for exploring quantum computing is to understand that while many of the principles are counterintuitive, the classical universe we know and love is but a mere shadow of the quantum fabric of reality. Part of [becoming comfortable with] the quantum is to become comfortable with [the limitations of our own perception](((eHOX7LFr0))). This limitation is analogous to [drawing a 3D object] [on a 2D sheet of paper]. [Take a look at] the wireframe below. [It can represent] either a box ([we can illustrate this] [with a glass on top]) or [it can be inverted into] a corner (we can [put the bottle inside] to make it flip to a corner [in our brains]).
    - [We are forced to see] [either one or the other] and [never both]. We can [change them back and forth], but because we are [stuck in a two dimensional representation] [we can only see one or the other]. Two dimensions is not enough for a [perfect representation] of [a three dimensional object]. Similarly the world of classical information in its [simplest encoding] is [represented in bits], 0s and 1s. [These are not enough though to] describe the [[quantum world]]. In the quantum world, we need [[quantum bit]]s, or [[qubit]]s, to [describe our information]. Like [putting the drink on top of the box] or [in the corner], we can [make a measurement] that will [force our qubit to tell us] a [[classical bit]], but [there is more information there] [that we can take advantage of].
(正如二维表述不足以完全展现一个三维物体，经典信息编码方式也不足以描述量子世界)

- [Quantum computers]([[quantum computer]]) will [use the rest of the information to] [achieve more computational power]. [This will be transformative with applications in] pharma, green new materials, logistics, finance, [big data] and more. For example, quantum computing [will be better at] [calculating the energy of molecules](((evYbUmoMf))) because this is a [fundamentally quantum problem]. [So if you can imagine] [an industry that deals with molecules], you can imagine an application of quantum computing. [Often people want to know] if quantum computers will be faster, and while [they will be able to] [do computations faster], [it is not because] they are [doing the same thing] [with more cycles]. Instead quantum computers take advantage of [a fundamentally different way of] [processing information]. To get a feel for that fundamental difference we will walk through an example that helps to illustrate the power of quantum computation.

- ## Meet a quantum drunk
    - We are going to think about the drunken walk. In the classical [[drunken walk]] (sometimes called the [[random walk]]) we have a drunk who is [leaving the restroom] and [trying to find his friend] [at the bar].
        - [Everyone basically looks the same] [at this hipster bar] and he has had one too many so he is [approaching a random person] [seated at the bar]. [When he discovers that] [the first person he has bothered] [is not his friend], he will [randomly go to] the next stool, either to the left or to the right. We can simulate our drunken walker by [flipping a coin and saying heads](((1OSvMn31p))) he will go right, tails he will go left.

        - [The next person] is also wrong and [his memory is short], so they will [move on to either the left or right] [with equal probability]. [This will go on until] [security is called] to [throw out the drunkard].
        - The [security team] [loves physics], so they decide to [keep a tally of] where they finally [catch up to the drunk] each time. Here is what security finds:
            - ![](https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Stack_04.gif)
            - The shape is a [[bell curve]], and the [interesting feature] of the bell curve is that [the spread of the middle] ([the most likely place to] [find the drunk]) is the square root of [the number of steps the drunken walker takes]. When the drunk tries nine barstools, [the spread of the bell curve](((ZEtrzJqks))) is three; security [can likely find them within] three barstools of where they started. When the drunk [makes 100 attempts], security will find the most likely within the ten [closest stools] [to where they started]. These statistics help security know where they are most likely to find the drunken walker, who is somewhere [near the center].

    - Now the security team [has a model they can use to] keep up with the [classical drunks], but unfortunately at this bar there are also [quantum drunks]. Whereas the classical drunk is [a simple coin flip for each direction], for the quantum drunk [the coin is quantum], and can be [in a superposition of heads and tails] [at the same time]. The quantum drunk is [following a path that] is [a superposition of left and right] [at each bar stool].

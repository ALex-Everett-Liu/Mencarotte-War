- A power supply unit (PSU) converts [[mains AC]] ([[mains electricity]]) to [low-voltage regulated DC power](((8y3Z2XFwm))) for [the internal components of a computer]. Modern [[personal computer (PC)]]s universally use [switched-mode power supplies]([[switched-mode power supply (SMPS)]]). Some power supplies have a [[manual switch]] for selecting [[input voltage]], while others [automatically adapt to] the [[mains voltage]].

    - Most modern [desktop personal computer] power supplies conform to the [[ATX specification]], which includes [[form factor]] 形状因数 and [[voltage tolerance]]s. 电压公差 While an [ATX power supply] is connected to the [[mains supply]], it always provides [a 5-volt standby (5VSB) power]([[standby power]]) 备用/待机 so that the [[standby function]]s on the computer and [certain peripherals]([[peripheral]]) are powered.

        - ATX power supplies are [turned on and off by a signal from] the [[motherboard]]. They also [provide a signal to the motherboard] to indicate when the [[DC voltage]]s are [in spec](((ocQEWXHMT))), so that the computer is able to safely [[power up]] and [[boot]]. [The most recent] [ATX PSU standard] is version 2.31 as of mid-2008.
- Functions
    - The [[desktop computer]] power supply converts the [[alternating current (AC)]] from a [[wall socket]] of [[mains electricity]] to a low-voltage [[direct current (DC)]] to [operate the motherboard], processor and [[peripheral device]]s. Several [direct-current voltages]([[DC voltage]]) are required, and they [must be regulated with some accuracy] to [provide stable operation of the computer]([[stable operation]]). A [[power supply rail]] or [[voltage rail]] refers to a [single voltage] provided by a PSU.[1]

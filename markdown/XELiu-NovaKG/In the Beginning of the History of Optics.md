- The origins of [optical technology] [date back to remote antiquity]. Exodus 38:8 (ca. 1200 B.C.E.) recounts how Bezaleel, while [preparing the ark and tabernacle], 约柜和帐幕 recast “the [looking-glasses](((Nv_Ek12L4))) of the women” into a [brass laver] (a [ceremonial basin]). 重铸成一个黄铜盆 (仪式盆) [Early mirrors]([[mirror]]) were made of [[polished copper]], [[bronze]], and later on of [[speculum]], a [copper alloy rich in tin](((_XzhKPZwW))). [Specimens]([[specimen]]) have survived from ancient Egypt—a mirror [in perfect condition] was unearthed along with some tools from the [workers’ quarters] 工人宿舍 near [the pyramid of Sesostris II] (ca. 1900 b.c.e.) in the [Nile valley]. 
    - The Greek philosophers Pythagoras, Democritus, Empedocles, Plato, Aristotle, and others [developed several theories] of [the nature of light](((MfTZGKCU9))). The [[rectilinear propagation]] of light (p. 99) was known, as was [[the Law of Reflection]] (p. 105) enunciated by Euclid (300 b.c.e.) in his book __Catoptrics__. 反射光学 [Hero of Alexandria] attempted to [explain both these phenomena] by asserting that light [traverses the shortest allowed path] 横越 between two points. The [[burning glass]] (a [[positive lens]] [used to start fires]) was alluded to by Aristophanes in his [comic play] __The Clouds__ (424 b.c.e.).

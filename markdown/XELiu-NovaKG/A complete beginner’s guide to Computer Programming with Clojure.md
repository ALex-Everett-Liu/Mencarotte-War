- Part 1 — A complete beginner's guide to Computer Programming with Clojure.
    - **Part 1 **is [a simple introduction to] the world of [computer coding]. [A number of parts] will follow and each [should be considered like] [the chapter of a Book]. In **Part 2**, [you will be introduced to] a free Virtual Machine with all the [necessary resources] pre-installed.
    - ## Introduction
        - I often refer to a computer, or [computing enabled device] such as a [[smartphone]], as the ‘Machine’. In other words, [any machine capable of] being programmed (Not your [washing machine](((TIIb--9QZ)))). I first began to try and understand the ‘Machine’ in 1982. At this time, Computer Science, or as it was known at the time, Computer Studies, was the ‘new kid’ in school. At the time, I saved up all my pennies from [paper-rounds](((QAtW1P6XK))) and other [[part-time job]]s to purchase my very first Machine, a Sinclair ZX81. At this time, the [programming language] to know was [[Language/BASIC]]. BASIC stood for ‘Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.’ 
            - Compared to my ZX81, the [school computer] was [a highly advanced device] built by a [local company] called Research Machines. It had a 5 and a quarter inch [[floppy disk]] 5.25 英寸软盘 and 4K RAM; [wealthy schools] had [BBC Micros] or Apples! At this time, the Processor or [[CPU (central processing unit)]] was more than likely a [Z80 processor]. To get the most out of this processor (especially with only 1K of RAM), you needed to know [low-level Assembly language](((egi-uI_wp))). This meant [injecting your BASIC code with] Peek and Poke commands — necessary to force in Assembly mnemonics and [get the most out of the processor](((5Y6mz33w8))). Nevertheless, because of [inherent hardware limitations](((Xt-z5MCz8))), [coding on these old machines] ensured you [learned to code efficiently and strictly].

        - Now everyone is an ‘IT Expert.’ To be an IT expert, [all you need to do] is [a few vanity courses] and, perhaps, a [Master's degree](((IEb4EMouZ))). There are now more ‘IT Experts’ than those that can actually code. Nevertheless, [you will never really understand] the Machine unless you can [talk to the machine]. To talk to the Machine, [you need to know] [how to code].
    - ## Coding aka Programming
        - All computer programs can be built out of just three elements, **__sequence__**, **__selection__**, and **__repetition__**. Sequence refers to [a sequence of instructions](((kj2eAb_ww))) that [follow a specific order]. For example:
            - 1. Wake-up
2. Get out of bed
3. Shower
4. Get dressed
5. Drink Coffee
6. Leave for work
            - [The important thing about] Sequence is the order. You wouldn’t want to Shower [before you woke-up]?
    - ## Why Clojure
        - The Clojure language was [initially released in] 2007. Clojure is [a modern dialect of] [an old language] called LISP. For many reasons, [which I will not go into] because to do so would [require a whole other book] (or books), LISP [became indispensable in] [early AI (Artificial Intelligence) research](((ML1MzRFQt))). Like all [LISP-like languages](((SzZImJXGt))), Clojure code is written as **__S-expressions__**. An [S-expression](((YJ2oDHxYT))) is [a simple structure]:
**__(function argument argument … )__**

            - For example, to add two numbers:
`(+ 2 3)`

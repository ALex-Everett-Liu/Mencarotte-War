- Cotoami (言編み・言網)  is [a platform where people can] [weave a large network of wisdom] from [tiny ideas].
- ## Concept
    - In Cotoami, you [post your ideas and thoughts] like chatting. The [[timeline]] actually has a [chatting feature] where you can [chat with other users] [sharing the same space].
    - [You would feel free to] write anything that [comes in your mind]. Your posts just [flow into the past] unless they are [[pinned]]:

    - Then you [make connections to] [enrich your stock] (there are two [[pane]]s side by side representing [flow and stock](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890) respectvely).
    - ### Basic building blocks
        - [Individual posts] are called "Cotos", which is a Japanese word meaning "thing", and there's a [special type] of Coto called "Cotonoma" (Coto-no-ma means "a space of Cotos"). A Cotonoma is a Coto that has [a dedicated chat timeline] [associated with it]. [These two concepts] are [basic building blocks] of a knowledge base in Cotoami.
            - ![cotonoma-01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cotoami/cotoami/develop/docs/images/cotonoma.png)
            - As you can see in the image above, Cotonomas are [posted to a timeline] like Cotos. Actually, you can treat Cotonomas as Cotos. They [can be pinned to] another Cotonoma or connected to other Cotos.
    - ### Separation of writing and connecting
        - In many cases of note-taking, writing and [connecting things] are [happening at the same time]. You [put things into categories], which are represented as, for example, sections in a notebook, [folders/directories] [on an operating system] or nodes in [[outliner]]. You almost connect things unconsciously just following [[vertical relationship]]s, which will be explained later, to make a [[tree structure]].

        - Cotoami also [supports this way of] [organizing things], but [its main aim is to] [separate writing and connecting] to make the latter [a more conscious step]. For example, Cotoami has a [random/shuffle feature] to encourage you to [observe a variety of] Cotos to [discover new connections](((O4B8SsQYC))).
    - ### Cotoami's concept of [[knowledge generation]]
        - [Collect random ideas] by [posting Cotos to a timeline].
        - [Look for connections between] Cotos and [make them as they are found].
        - Cotonomatize: Convert **a hub Coto that [has many outbound connections]** and [looks worth discussing] into a Cotonoma. (a bit like the generation of a MoC)

        - [Repeat the same thing] in the new Cotonoma.

    - ### Cotonomatizing
        - During a process of chatting, [posting random ideas] and creating [[structured content]] by connecting Cotos, some Cotos would [collect more connections than others]. Those Cotos are possibly [important to you or your team] and worth discussing as [[independent topic]]s. Cotonomatizing allows you to convert them into Cotonomas to [create new dedicated places to] [discuss and research the topics] [in a spontaneous way].
    - ### Linking Phrases
        - Since the version 0.21.0, you can annotate connections. The term "Linking Phrases" is borrowed from Concept Maps. Actually you can create concept maps with this feature as introduced in the [Concept Mapping](https://github.com/cotoami/cotoami#concept-mapping) section.
        - Cotonomas (Cotonomatizing) and Linking Phrases are the most two important features so far in Cotoami.
        - Why is the Linking Phrases feature so important? Concept mapping is a good way to demonstrate this feature, but an important difference is that Cotoami's linking phrases are optional. That means you should annotate only connections whose relationships are obscure to you. These obscure relationships are possibly valuable knowledge for you (since you didn't know them well before), and should be highlighted in your knowledge-base (that's why annotated connections are rendered so that they stand out). I personally call them Horizontal Relationships.

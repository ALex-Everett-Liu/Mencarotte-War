- Cotoami (言編み・言網)  is [a platform where people can] [weave a large network of wisdom] from [tiny ideas].
- ## Concept
    - In Cotoami, you [post your ideas and thoughts] like chatting. The [[timeline]] actually has a [chatting feature] where you can [chat with other users] [sharing the same space].
    - [You would feel free to] write anything that [comes in your mind]. Your posts just [flow into the past] unless they are [[pinned]]:
210617-01:05
    - Then you [make connections to] [enrich your stock] (there are two [[pane]]s side by side representing [flow and stock](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890) respectvely).
    - ### Basic building blocks
        - [Individual posts] are called "Cotos", which is a Japanese word meaning "thing", and there's a [special type] of Coto called "Cotonoma" (Coto-no-ma means "a space of Cotos"). A Cotonoma is a Coto that has [a dedicated chat timeline] [associated with it]. [These two concepts] are [basic building blocks] of a knowledge base in Cotoami.
            - ![cotonoma-01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cotoami/cotoami/develop/docs/images/cotonoma.png)
            - As you can see in the image above, Cotonomas are [posted to a timeline] like Cotos. Actually, you can treat Cotonomas as Cotos. They [can be pinned to] another Cotonoma or connected to other Cotos.
    - ### Separation of writing and connecting
        - In many cases of note-taking, writing and [connecting things] are [happening at the same time]. You [put things into categories], which are represented as, for example, sections in a notebook, [folders/directories] [on an operating system] or nodes in [[outliner]]. You almost connect things unconsciously just following [[vertical relationship]]s, which will be explained later, to make a [[tree structure]].

        - Cotoami also [supports this way of] [organizing things], but [its main aim is to] [separate writing and connecting] to make the latter [a more conscious step]. For example, Cotoami has a [random/shuffle feature] to encourage you to [observe a variety of] Cotos to [discover new connections](((O4B8SsQYC))).
    - ### Cotoami's concept of [[knowledge generation]]
        - [Collect random ideas] by [posting Cotos to a timeline].
        - [Look for connections between] Cotos and [make them as they are found].
        - Cotonomatize: Convert **a hub Coto that [has many outbound connections]** and [looks worth discussing] into a Cotonoma. (a bit like the generation of a MoC)
210620-20:30
        - [Repeat the same thing] in the new Cotonoma.
        - ![](https://github.com/cotoami/cotoami/raw/develop/docs/images/cotoami-concept.png)
    - ### Cotonomatizing
        - During a process of chatting, [posting random ideas] and creating [[structured content]] by connecting Cotos, some Cotos would [collect more connections than others]. Those Cotos are possibly [important to you or your team] and worth discussing as [[independent topic]]s. Cotonomatizing allows you to convert them into Cotonomas to [create new dedicated places to] [discuss and research the topics] [in a spontaneous way].
    - ### Linking Phrases
        - Since the version 0.21.0, you can [annotate connections](((6LPioDuVY))). The term "Linking Phrases" is borrowed from Concept Maps. Actually you can create [[concept map]]s with this feature as introduced in the [Concept Mapping](https://github.com/cotoami/cotoami#concept-mapping) section.
            - Cotonomas (Cotonomatizing) and Linking Phrases are the most two important features so far in Cotoami.
        - Why is the linking phrases feature so important? Concept mapping is a good way to [demonstrate this feature], but [an important difference] is that Cotoami's [[linking phrase]]s are optional. That means you should annotate only connections [whose relationships are obscure to you]. These [obscure relationships] are possibly [valuable knowledge] for you (since you didn't know them well before), and [should be highlighted] [in your knowledge-base] (that's why annotated connections are rendered [so that they stand out]). [I personally call them] [Horizontal Relationships].
210620-21:40
(某些细微的很容易被忽视的横向关系是最需要标注的，一目了然的包含或演绎关系这类纵向/垂直层级关系倒是无需次次标注)
            - On the other hand, [Vertical Relationships] [generally means] [inclusive or deductive relationships] like "includes", "results in", or "is determined by". ^^[Simple arrow lines] [would be enough to] [express these relationships] and [you wouldn't feel the need for] annotations [in most cases].^^
            - So [whether a connection is vertical or horizontal] [depends on your context] [in the same way as] Cotonomas are [concepts emerged in the context of] your knowledge creation.
        - The [optional linking phrases] are helpful especially when your knowledge graph [grows larger].
            - When a graph is [relatively simple] with [fewer nodes and connections], it works like a [[mind map]]. You can [grasp the tree structure] even if there are some [[crosslink]]s. However, [when a graph grows larger] and [becomes more complex], [it'll become difficult to] [follow the structure].
210620-21:48
            - In that phase, [annotated connections] [become more important than] plain ones because they work as [[highlight]]s in the connections. [You just need to focus on] blue connections in a graph to [grasp what you've learned so far].
- ## Concept Mapping
    - [What is a Concept Map?](http://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/conceptmap.php)
    - [The screenshot above] is an example of a concept map [explaining why we have seasons] (originally presented in the article at Concept Maps official website: [here](http://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/theory-of-concept-maps)).
    - [If you are interested in] how this concept map was created with Cotoami, here is a [youtube video] to [demonstrate the process]: "Making a concept map with Cotoami" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYQrsGnSoLU

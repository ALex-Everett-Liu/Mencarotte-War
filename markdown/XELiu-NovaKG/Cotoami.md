- Cotoami (言編み・言網)  is [a platform where people can] [weave a large network of wisdom] from [tiny ideas].
- ### Concept
    - In Cotoami, you [post your ideas and thoughts] like chatting. The [[timeline]] actually has a [chatting feature] where you can [chat with other users] [sharing the same space].
    - [You would feel free to] write anything that [comes in your mind]. Your posts just [flow into the past] unless they are [[pinned]]:

    - Then you [make connections to] [enrich your stock] (there are two [[pane]]s side by side representing [flow and stock](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890) respectvely).

- ## Abstract
    - [Gaseous pollutants]([[gaseous pollutant]]) have been an [environmental concern] since 1956, when the first [clean air act] was [established in the United Kingdom]. [Monitoring of gaseous emissions] is a [legal requirement] [in most countries], and this has [generated a large demand for] inexpensive, portable, and versatile [[gas analyser]]s for [the measurement of gaseous emissions]. Many of the current [commercial gas analysers] [have differing advantages and disadvantages], however, [high cost] is [an important factor]. Instruments with low [[detection limit]]s and the ability to [measure multiple gases] [tend to be very expensive], whereas, single gas analysers [tend to be much more affordable].
    - A non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometer, [originally developed for] a previous M.Sc. project, [has been further developed in order to] [increase the sensitivity] and to [extend the instrument to] [the measurement of multiple gases]. [This type of instrument] [would be useful for] environmental, industrial, and [research applications]. The instrument was [inexpensive to construct] [when compared with the cost of] current commercial gas analysers, is robust, and is [partially portable around the laboratory].
- Chapter I   Introduction
    - Gaseous pollutants [released into the atmosphere] are an [environmental concern] both [on a global scale], for example [[climate change]], and a local scale, for example [[photochemical smog]]. [Current methods for] [measuring and monitoring gases] are costly and limited in their applications. The main objective of this research was to develop a gas analyser with high sensitivity, high versatility and [a low associated cost].
    - Many of the [commercially available] [gas measurement techniques] with high sensitivity and versatility [are also very expensive]. There is a small selection of commercially available instruments that are affordable and also [achieve high sensitivity], however, these instruments are typically [single gas analysers] and are [limited in their application]. [This research was focused on the development of] a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometer [initially constructed by] Timothy Simpson as an [M.Sc. research project] in 2004. [The goal was to achieve] high sensitivity for [trace gas measurements] of [specific environmental gases], while being of low cost compared to [currently available commercial instruments]. Carbon dioxide (CO2 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH4) gases were selected as [analyte gases] because they are all known [greenhouse gases] arising from [[intensive farming]].

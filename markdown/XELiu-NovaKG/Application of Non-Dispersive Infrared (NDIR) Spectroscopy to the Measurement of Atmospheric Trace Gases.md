- ## Abstract
    - Gaseous pollutants have been an environmental concern since 1956, when the first clean air act was established in the United Kingdom. Monitoring of gaseous emissions is a legal requirement in most countries, and this has generated a large demand for inexpensive, portable, and versatile gas analysers for the measurement of gaseous emissions. Many of the current commercial gas analysers have differing advantages and disadvantages, however, high cost is an important factor. Instruments with low detection limits and the ability to measure multiple gases tend to be very expensive, whereas, single gas analysers tend to be much more affordable.
    - A non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometer, originally developed for a previous M.Sc. project, has been further developed in order to increase the sensitivity and to extend the instrument to the measurement of multiple gases. This type of instrument would be useful for environmental, industrial, and research applications. The instrument was inexpensive to construct when compared with the cost of current commercial gas analysers, is robust, and is partially portable around the laboratory.

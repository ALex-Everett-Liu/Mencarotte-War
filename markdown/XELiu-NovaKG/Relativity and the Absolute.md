- Some discoveries [provide answers to questions]. Other discoveries are so deep that they [cast questions in a whole new light], 从全新的角度提出问题 showing that [previous mysteries] were [misperceived through lack of knowledge]. You could [spend a lifetime] —in antiquity, some did—[wondering what happens] [when you reach earth's edge], or [trying to figure out] who or what [lives on earth's underbelly]. But [when you learn that] [the earth is round], you see that the previous mysteries are not solved; instead, they're [rendered irrelevant]. 它们变得无关紧要
    - During the first decades of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein [made two deep discoveries]. Each [caused a radical upheaval in] our understanding of space and time. Einstein dismantled 拆除 the rigid, absolute structures that Newton had erected, and built his own tower, synthesizing space and time [in a manner that] was [completely unanticipated]. 非先行的, 非预期的 When he was done, time had [become so enmeshed with space] that [the reality of one] could no longer be [pondered separately from the other](((z-EFMT4LZ))). And so, by the third decade of the twentieth century [the question of the corporeality of space] 物质性问题 was outmoded; 已经过时了 its [Einsteinian reframing], as we'll talk about shortly, became; Is spacetime a something? With that seemingly [slight modification], our understanding of [reality's arena] was [completely transformed].

- ## Is Empty Space Empty?
    - Light was the [primary actor] [in the relativity drama written by] Einstein [in the early years of] [the twentieth century]. And it was the work of [James Clerk Maxwell] that [set the stage for] Einstein's [dramatic insights]. In the mid-1800s, Maxwell discovered [four powerful equations] that, for the first time, set out [a rigorous theoretical framework for] understanding electricity, magnetism, and their [[intimate relationship]].[1] Maxwell [developed these equations] by [carefully studying the work of] the English physicist [Michael Faraday], who in the early 1800s had [carried out tens of thousands of experiments] that exposed [hitherto unknown features] of [electricity and magnetism]. 迄今未知的 Faraday's [key breakthrough] was [the concept of the field]. 
        - Later expanded on by Maxwell and many others, this concept has [had an enormous influence on] [the development of physics] [during the last two centuries], and [underlies many of the little mysteries] [we encounter in everyday life]. When you go through [[airport security]], how is it that [a machine that doesn't touch you] can determine whether you're carrying [[metallic object]]s? When you have an MRI, how is it that a device that [remains outside your body] can [take a detailed picture of] your insides? When you look at a [[compass]], how is it that [the needle swings around] and [points north] even though [nothing seems to nudge it](((_Eklt4uTj)))? [The familiar answer] to the last question invokes [the earth's magnetic field], and the concept of [[magnetic field]]s helps to [explain the previous two examples] as well.

    - I've never seen a better way to get a visceral sense of a magnetic field than the elementary school demonstration in which iron filings are sprinkled in the vicinity of a bar magnet. After a little shaking, the iron filings align themselves in an orderly pattern of arcs that begin at the magnet's north pole and swing up and around, to end at the magnet's south pole, as in Figure 3.1. The pattern traced by the iron filings is direct evidence that the magnet creates an invisible something that permeates the space around it—a something that can, for example, exert a force on shards of metal. The invisible something is the magnetic field and, to our intuition, it resembles a mist or essence that can fill a region of space and thereby exert a force beyond the physical extent of the magnet itself. A magnetic field provides a magnet what an army provides a dictator and what auditors provide the IRS: influence beyond their physical boundaries, which allows force to be exerted out in the "field." That is why a magnetic field is also called a force field.
        - Figure 3.1 Iron filings sprinkled near a bar magnet trace out its magnetic field.

- Some discoveries [provide answers to questions]. Other discoveries are so deep that they [cast questions in a whole new light], 从全新的角度提出问题 showing that [previous mysteries] were [misperceived through lack of knowledge]. You could [spend a lifetime] —in antiquity, some did—[wondering what happens] [when you reach earth's edge], or [trying to figure out] who or what [lives on earth's underbelly]. But [when you learn that] [the earth is round], you see that the previous mysteries are not solved; instead, they're [rendered irrelevant]. 它们变得无关紧要
    - During the first decades of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein [made two deep discoveries]. Each [caused a radical upheaval in] our understanding of space and time. Einstein dismantled 拆除 the rigid, absolute structures that Newton had erected, and built his own tower, synthesizing space and time [in a manner that] was [completely unanticipated]. 非先行的, 非预期的 When he was done, time had [become so enmeshed with space] that [the reality of one] could no longer be [pondered separately from the other](((z-EFMT4LZ))). And so, by the third decade of the twentieth century [the question of the corporeality of space] 物质性问题 was outmoded; 已经过时了 its [Einsteinian reframing], as we'll talk about shortly, became; Is spacetime a something? With that seemingly [slight modification], our understanding of [reality's arena] was [completely transformed].

- ## Is Empty Space Empty?
    - Light was the [primary actor] [in the relativity drama written by] Einstein [in the early years of] [the twentieth century]. And it was the work of [James Clerk Maxwell] that [set the stage for] Einstein's [dramatic insights]. In the mid-1800s, Maxwell discovered [four powerful equations] that, for the first time, set out [a rigorous theoretical framework for] understanding electricity, magnetism, and their [[intimate relationship]].[1] Maxwell [developed these equations] by [carefully studying the work of] the English physicist [Michael Faraday], who in the early 1800s had [carried out tens of thousands of experiments] that exposed [hitherto unknown features] of [electricity and magnetism]. 迄今未知的 Faraday's [key breakthrough] was [the concept of the field]. 
        - Later expanded on by Maxwell and many others, this concept has [had an enormous influence on] [the development of physics] [during the last two centuries], and [underlies many of the little mysteries] [we encounter in everyday life]. When you go through [[airport security]], how is it that [a machine that doesn't touch you] can determine whether you're carrying [[metallic object]]s? When you have an MRI, how is it that a device that [remains outside your body] can [take a detailed picture of] your insides? When you look at a [[compass]], how is it that [the needle swings around] and [points north] even though [nothing seems to nudge it](((_Eklt4uTj)))? [The familiar answer] to the last question invokes [the earth's magnetic field], and the concept of [[magnetic field]]s helps to [explain the previous two examples] as well.

        - I've never seen a better way to [get a visceral sense of] 内脏, 发自肺腑的 a magnetic field than the [[elementary school]] [demonstration](((LPnAW8src))) in which [[iron filing]]s are [sprinkled in the vicinity of] a [[bar magnet]]. 将铁屑撒在条形磁铁附近 After a little shaking, the iron filings [align themselves in an orderly pattern of arcs](((cgdxKHAXs))) that begin at the magnet's [[north pole]] and [swing up and around], to end at the magnet's south pole, as in Figure 3.1. [The pattern traced by the iron filings] is [direct evidence] that the magnet [creates an invisible something] that [permeates the space around it](((4JdZpstHz)))—a something that can, for example, [exert a force on] [shards of metal]. 在金属碎片上施加作用力 [The invisible something] is the magnetic field and, to our intuition, it [resembles a mist or essence that] can [fill a region of space] and thereby [exert a force beyond] [the physical extent] of the magnet itself. 物理范围 A magnetic field provides a magnet [what an army provides a dictator](((Qgc4zDAjC))) and [what auditors provide the IRS]: 审计员, 稽核员; 国内税务署, 国税局 influence beyond their [physical boundaries], which [allows force to be exerted out in] the "field." That is why a magnetic field is also called a [[force field]].

            - **Figure 3.1** Iron filings [sprinkled near a bar magnet] [trace out its magnetic field].
        - It is the pervasive, [space-filling capability] of magnetic fields that [makes them so useful]. An [airport metal detector]([[metal detector]])'s magnetic field [seeps through your clothes] 渗漏, 漉 and causes metallic objects to [give off their own magnetic fields] —fields that then [exert an influence back on] the detector, causing its alarm to sound. An MRI's magnetic field [seeps into your body], causing [particular atoms] to [gyrate in just the right way] to 旋涡 [generate their own magnetic fields]—fields that [the machine can detect] and [decode into a picture](((D_5CGNDP0))) of [internal tissues]. [The earth's magnetic field] seeps through the compass [casing and turns the needle], causing it to [point along an arc] that, as a result of [eons-long geophysical processes], 漫长的 is aligned in a nearly [[south-north direction]].

        - Magnetic fields are [one familiar kind of] field, but Faraday also analyzed another: the electric field. This is the field that [causes your wool scarf to crackle](((aKVdvxrEI))), 羊毛围巾 zaps your hand [in a carpeted room] 你的手会被震碎lol when you [touch a metal doorknob], 门把手 and [makes your skin tingle] 刺痛 when you're up in the mountains [during a powerful lightning storm](((M1-HutX1C))). And if you happened to [examine a compass] [during such a storm], the way its [[magnetic needle]] deflected this way 偏转 and that [as the bolts of electric lightning flashed nearby] would have [given you a hint of] [a deep interconnection between] [electric and magnetic fields] —something [first discovered by] the [Danish physicist] [Hans Oersted] and [investigated thoroughly by] Faraday [through meticulous experimentation]. 一丝不苟, 过于细致 Just as developments in the [[stock market]] can affect the [[bond market]] which can then affect the stock market, and so on, these scientists found that [changes in an electric field] [can produce changes in] [a nearby magnetic field], which can then [cause changes in] the electric field, and so on. Maxwell found [the mathematical underpinnings of] 支承, 托底 these interrelationships, and because his equations showed that electric and magnetic fields are 缠绕在一起 as entwined as the fibers in [a Rastafarian's dreadlocks], “骇人”长发绺 they were eventually christened [[electromagnetic field]]s, and the influence they exert the [[electromagnetic force]].

        - Today, we are [constantly immersed in a sea of] electromagnetic fields. Your [[cellular telephone]] and [car radio] [work over enormous expanses] because the electromagnetic fields [broadcast by telephone companies](((M3_iGGgit))) and [[radio station]]s [suffuse impressively wide regions of space](((6KivDwjhC))). The same goes for [wireless Internet connections]; computers can [pluck the entire World Wide Web from] [electromagnetic fields that are vibrating all around us] —in fact, right through us. Of course, in Maxwell's day, [electromagnetic technology] was less developed, but among scientists [his feat was no less recognized]: through the language of fields, Maxwell had shown that [electricity and magnetism], although initially [viewed as distinct], are really just [different aspects of] a single [[physical entity]].

        - Later on, we'll encounter other kinds of fields —gravitational fields, nuclear fields, Higgs fields, and so on —and [it will become increasingly clear that] [the field concept] is central to our [modern formulation of physical law]. But for now [the critical next step] in our story is also due to Maxwell. Upon [further analyzing] his equations, he found that [changes or disturbances to electromagnetic fields](((U9gddgdYK))) [travel in a wavelike manner] [at a particular speed]: 670 million miles per hour. As this is precisely the value other experiments had found for [the speed of light](((b9uW7Qkyi))), Maxwell realized that light [must be nothing other than] an [[electromagnetic wave]], one that [has the right properties to] [interact with chemicals] in our [[retinas]] and [give us the sensation of sight]. This achievement made Maxwell's [already towering discoveries] all the more remarkable: he had linked the force produced by magnets, the influence exerted by electrical charges, and the light we use to [see the universe] —but it also [raised a deep question].
(进一步统一了光和电磁波)
210409-15:18
            - When we say that [the speed of light] is 670 million miles per hour, experience, and our discussion so far, teach us this is [a meaningless statement] if we don't specify [relative to what] [this speed is being measured]. [The funny thing was that] Maxwell's equations [just gave this number], 670 million miles per hour, without specifying or [apparently relying on any such reference]. It was as if someone [gave the location for a party as] 22 miles north without [specifying the reference location](((ls-eUqsX-))), without specifying [north of what]. Most physicists, including Maxwell, [attempted to explain] [the speed his equations gave] [in the following way]: [Familiar waves such as] [ocean waves] or [sound waves] are [carried by a substance](((WITF3p_Ln))), a [medium](((qfU6t6GvB))). Ocean waves are [carried by water]. Sound waves are [carried by air]. And the speeds of these waves are [specified with respect to the medium]. [When we talk about] [the speed of sound]([[sound speed]]) at [[room temperature]] being 767 miles per hour (__also known as Mach 1__, after the same Ernst Mach encountered earlier), we mean that sound waves [travel through otherwise still air] [at this speed]. 
                - Naturally, then, physicists surmised that [[light wave]]s —electromagnetic waves —must also [travel through some particular medium], one that [had never been seen or detected] but that must exist. To give [this unseen light-carrying stuff] due respect, 应有的尊重 it was given a name: the [luminiferous aether](((Xuq9V2ETn))), 发光以太 or the [[aether]] for short, the latter being [an ancient term] that [Aristotle used to describe] the [magical catchall substance] 装杂物的容器；总受器；分沫器 ; 包罗万象的 of which [heavenly bodies] were imagined to be made. And, to [square this proposal with] Maxwell's results, 相吻合 [it was suggested that] his equations implicitly [took the perspective of someone at rest] [with respect to the aether]. The 670 million miles per hour his equations came up with, then, was [the speed of light]([[light speed]]) [relative to the stationary aether].
(一般来说，波都是由某种媒介物质所携带的，其波速即是波相对于媒介的速度)
210409-15:31, 210410-05:31
            - As you can see, [there is a striking similarity between] the luminiferous aether and [Newton's absolute space]. They both [originated in attempts to] [provide a reference for] [defining motion]; accelerated motion led to absolute space, [light's motion] led to the luminiferous aether. In fact, many physicists [viewed the aether as] a down-to-earth stand-in for the divine spirit that Henry More, Newton, and others had envisioned [permeating absolute space]. (Newton and others in his age had even used the term "aether" in their descriptions of absolute space.) But what actually is the aether? What is it made of? Where did it come from? Does it exist everywhere? These questions about the aether are the same ones that for centuries had been asked about absolute space. But whereas the full Machian test for absolute space involved spinning around in a completely empty universe, physicists were able to propose doable experiments to determine whether the aether really existed. For example, if you swim through water toward an oncoming water wave, the wave approaches you more quickly; if you swim away from the wave, it approaches you more slowly. Similarly, if you move through the supposed aether toward or away from an oncoming light wave, the light wave's approach should, by the same reasoning, be faster or slower than 670 million miles per hour. But in 1887, when Albert Michelson and Edward Morley measured the speed of light, time and time again they found exactly the same speed of 670 million miles per hour regardless of their motion or that of the light's source. All sorts of clever arguments were devised to explain these results. Maybe, some suggested, the experimenters were unwittingly dragging the aether along with them as they moved. Maybe, a few ventured, the equipment was being warped as it moved through the aether, corrupting the measurements. But it was not until Einstein had his revolutionary insight that the explanation finally became clear.

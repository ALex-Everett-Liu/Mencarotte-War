    - [Most territories apply standards to] [the equipment that can be sold] that [include requirements to limit emissions of] [[radio frequency interference (RFI)]] or [susceptibility to incoming RFI]. In Europe we have (EMC) Directive 2014/30/EU and in North America they have FCC Part 15, military applications have MIL specs to name 3. EMC filters are very often needed to specifically help meet the conducted immunity and emissions.

- Terahertz radiation – also known as [submillimeter radiation], [[terahertz wave]]s, [[tremendously high frequency (THF)]][1], T-rays, T-waves, T-light, T-lux or THz – [consists of electromagnetic waves within] [the ITU-designated band of frequencies] from 0.3 to 3 [[terahertz (THz)]],[2] although the [upper boundary] is [somewhat arbitrary] and is [considered by some sources as] 30 THz.[3] One terahertz is 10^12 Hz or 1000 [[GHz]]. [Wavelengths of radiation in] the terahertz band [correspondingly range from] 1 mm to 0.1 mm = 100 µm. 
    - Because terahertz radiation [begins at a wavelength of] [around 1 millimeter] and [proceeds into shorter wavelengths], [it is sometimes known as] the [submillimeter band](((IFBAjEWoA))), and its radiation as [submillimeter waves], especially in astronomy. This band of electromagnetic radiation lies within the [transition region] [between microwave and far infrared], and can be regarded as either.

        - Terahertz waves [lie at the far end of] the [infrared band], [just before the start of] the [microwave band].
    - Terahertz radiation is [strongly absorbed by] [the gases of the atmosphere], and in air is [attenuated to zero] [within a few meters],[4][5] so [it is not practical for] [[terrestrial radio communication]]. It can [penetrate thin layers of materials](((hYzebUYge))) but is [blocked by thicker objects]. [THz beams](((Ts_LApinm))) [transmitted through materials] can be used for [[material characterization]], layer inspection, 分层检测 relief measurement,[6] 浮雕/释压测量 and as [a lower-energy alternative to X-rays] for [producing high resolution images of] [the interior of solid objects].[7]

    - Terahertz radiation [occupies a middle ground] where [the ranges of microwaves] and [infrared light waves] overlap, known as the “[[terahertz gap]]”; it is called a “gap” because the technology for its [generation and manipulation] is [still in its infancy]. The [generation and modulation] of [electromagnetic waves in this frequency range] [ceases to be possible by] the [conventional electronic devices] used to [generate radio waves] and microwaves, [requiring the development of] [new devices and techniques].

- ## Introduction
    - Terahertz radiation falls in between infrared radiation and microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum, and it shares some properties with each of these. Terahertz radiation travels in a line of sight and is non-ionizing. Like microwaves, terahertz radiation can penetrate a wide variety of non-conducting materials; clothing, paper, cardboard, wood, masonry, plastic and ceramics. The penetration depth is typically less than that of microwave radiation. Like infrared, terahertz radiation has limited penetration through fog and clouds and cannot penetrate liquid water or metal.[9] Terahertz radiation can penetrate some distance through body tissue like x-rays, but unlike them is non-ionizing, so it is of interest as a replacement for medical X-rays. Due to its longer wavelength, images made using terahertz waves have lower resolution than X-rays and need to be enhanced (see figure at right).[8]
    - ### Terahertz versus submillimeter waves
        - The terahertz band, covering the wavelength range between 0.1–1 mm, is identical to the submillimeter wavelength band. However, typically, the term "terahertz" is used more often in marketing in relation to generation and detection with pulsed lasers, as in terahertz time domain spectroscopy, while the term "submillimeter" is used for generation and detection with microwave technology, such as harmonic multiplication.[citation needed]

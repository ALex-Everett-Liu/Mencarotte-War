- There is [a renaissance underway] in [online text as a medium]. The [Four Horsemen]([[horsemen]]) of this emerging Textopia are:
    - [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), a hypertext [[publishing platform]] [best understood as] a [[medium]] for composing [conspiracy theories]([[conspiracy theory]]) and [[extended universe]]s. 制造阴谋论和扩展宇宙 #[[Roam Research]]
    - [Substack](https://substack.com/), a [careful and thorough] ground-up [[neoclassical]] [[reconstruction]] of the age-old [[email newsletter]]. 一个仔细和彻底的在新古典主义的基础上重建的古老的电子邮件通讯工具
    - [[static website]]s, built out of [[framework]]s like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) ([[full disclosure]]: a [[consulting client]]). 充分表达, 充分披露, 财务公开 | 咨询客户端
    - And finally, [Threaded Twitter](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1205983999274840064), a [[user-pioneered]] [[hack-turned-supported]] feature that has [wonderfully revitalized the platform]. #[[Threaded Twitter]]
        - revitalize: 使更强壮; 使恢复生机 -- 焕发了奇妙的活力
- I want to [take a stab at] [lightly theorizing this renaissance]. 尝试一下 And also speculating, in light of this renaissance, about what might be the eighth and penultimate death of [blogging]([[blog]]). And [the future of books]. So it’s going to be a sprawling, messy [hot take] on the [State of Textual Media]([[textual media]]). 杂乱无章的热议 Or at least a [simmering take], since [I’ve been thinking about] this [[stuff]] for a year [on the backburner]. 
    speculating: touji21, caice14, sisuo13
penultimate: 倒数第二次
    simmering: 用文火炖; 煨; 熬炼; 充满 ; 即将爆发 ; 酝酿
backburner: 次要地位; 从属地位; 在背地里
    bleeding edge: 最前沿, 最令人兴奋的发展阶段, 最先进的, 尖端的
visionary: 愿景, 有眼力, 富有远见; kongxiang13, huanxiang44, mengxiang43
    The [[text renaissance]] is an actual __renaissance. __It’s a [story] of [[history-inspired renewal]] 历史启发的复兴 in a very [fundamental way]: exciting [recent developments] are due in part to [a new generation of] young product visionaries [circling back to the early history] of [[digital text]], rediscovering old, abandoned ideas, and reimagining the [[bleeding edge]] in terms of the [unexplored adjacent possible] of [the 80s and 90s].
    I imagine, to [traditionalists] already bemoaning the [slow decline] of [[print-based media]] like books, [[newspaper]]s, and [[magazine]]s, [these technologies] [I want to talk about] might seem like the four horsemen of the [[apocalypse]]. But whether they strike you as renaissance or apocalyptic technologies, [they’re here], so [let’s meet them].
        - bemoan: aitan14, aidao14, wanxi31, yihan24
- Roam attempts to implement a [near-full conception] of [[hypertext]] as [originally conceived by] visionaries like [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[Ted Nelson]]. I’ve been using it for [a couple of months] now. It’s a revelation what a [thoughtfully implemented version] of a [powerful vision] can do to [unexpectedly transform something] you think you [understand deeply] at a __[Fingerspitzengefühl]__ ([[finger-tips feeling]]) [level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerspitzengef%C3%BChl), like I think I do writing.

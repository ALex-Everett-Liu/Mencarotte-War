    - There is [a renaissance underway] in [online text as a medium]. The [Four Horsemen]([[horsemen]]) of this emerging Textopia are:
        - [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), a hypertext [[publishing platform]] [best understood as] a [[medium]] for composing [conspiracy theories]([[conspiracy theory]]) and [[extended universe]]s. 制造阴谋论和扩展宇宙 #[[Roam Research]]
        - [Substack](https://substack.com/), a [careful and thorough] ground-up [[neoclassical]] [[reconstruction]] of the age-old [[email newsletter]]. 一个仔细和彻底的在新古典主义的基础上重建的古老的电子邮件通讯工具
        - [[static website]]s, built out of [[framework]]s like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) ([[full disclosure]]: a [[consulting client]]). 充分表达, 充分披露, 财务公开 | 咨询客户端
        - And finally, [Threaded Twitter](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1205983999274840064), a [[user-pioneered]] [[hack-turned-supported]] feature that has [wonderfully revitalized the platform]. #[[Threaded Twitter]]
            - revitalize: 使更强壮; 使恢复生机 -- 焕发了奇妙的活力
    - I want to [take a stab at] [lightly theorizing this renaissance]. 尝试一下 And also speculating, in light of this renaissance, about what might be the eighth and penultimate death of [blogging]([[blog]]). And [the future of books]. So it’s going to be a sprawling, messy [hot take] on the [State of Textual Media]([[textual media]]). 杂乱无章的热议 Or at least a [simmering take], since [I’ve been thinking about] this [[stuff]] for a year [on the backburner]. 
        speculating: touji21, caice14, sisuo13
penultimate: 倒数第二次
        simmering: 用文火炖; 煨; 熬炼; 充满 ; 即将爆发 ; 酝酿
backburner: 次要地位; 从属地位; 在背地里
        bleeding edge: 最前沿, 最令人兴奋的发展阶段, 最先进的, 尖端的
visionary: 愿景, 有眼力, 富有远见; kongxiang13, huanxiang44, mengxiang43
        The [[text renaissance]] is an actual __renaissance. __It’s a [story] of [[history-inspired renewal]] 历史启发的复兴 in a very [fundamental way]: exciting [recent developments] are due in part to [a new generation of] young product visionaries [circling back to the early history] of [[digital text]], rediscovering old, abandoned ideas, and reimagining the [[bleeding edge]] in terms of the [unexplored adjacent possible] of [the 80s and 90s].
        I imagine, to [traditionalists] already bemoaning the [slow decline] of [[print-based media]] like books, [[newspaper]]s, and [[magazine]]s, [these technologies] [I want to talk about] might seem like the four horsemen of the [[apocalypse]]. But whether they strike you as renaissance or apocalyptic technologies, [they’re here], so [let’s meet them].
            - bemoan: aitan14, aidao14, wanxi31, yihan24
- ### Roam
    - Roam attempts to implement a [near-full conception] of [[hypertext]] as [originally conceived by] visionaries like [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[Ted Nelson]]. I’ve been using it for [a couple of months] now. It’s a revelation what a [thoughtfully implemented version] of a [powerful vision] can do to [unexpectedly transform something] you think you [understand deeply] at a __[Fingerspitzengefühl]__ ([[finger-tips feeling]]) [level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerspitzengef%C3%BChl), like I think I do writing.
        - On the surface, Roam [looks like a cross between] a [slightly weird] [[wiki]] and a [[note-taking tool]] like [[Evernote]]. It’s not. It implements a few [key features] of 1980s [vintage hypertext visions] 复古超文本视觉 — [[block-level addressability]], [[transclusion]] (changes in [[referenced block]]s being “[[transfer-included]]” [wherever they are cited]), and [[bidirectional linking]] — that utterly transform the [[writing experience]] at the [finger-tips level]. 
            - You end up organizing [[high-level structure]] as you work at fleshing out [low-level chunks of information], 努力充实低层次的信息块 because the [[user experience (UX)]] collapses [high and low-level thinking]([[high-level thinking]]) into a [single behavior].
210226-00:22
            - transclusion/自动化全局修改：修改了某个[被引用的条目]，即在[所有][引用这段话]的[地方][即时地][自动同步]了[此次修改]
            - So you can write, structure, organize, [[refactor]], bundle/[[unbundle]], all in a single [[subconsciously learnable flow]]. 潜意识学习流 You don’t have to [think consciously about this]: it [gets compiled down to finger-tip skill] as you use it. This is [the sort of product] I was [dimly groping around for], 隐隐约约地摸索着寻找 and trying to build at [[Xerox]] 10 years ago. I [wasn’t smart enough to] pull it off, and back then, the technology wasn’t there either anyway. ^^Now the tech is there, and [there’s someone on the scene] [smart enough to pull it off].^^ 
                我也有着[同样的感触]，第一次[体验到这种感觉]还是 2019.10 遇到 TheBrian 的那次，当我尝试用[csv表格]去[组织概念]（早在2013/2014就尝试过，固体物理课后？）却[不得其法]时，搜索并[在知乎上发现了] TheBrian. 我意识到，这件我[渴求了很久]却[不得门道]的工具早已有[厉害的家伙]把它整了出来，多么惊喜的[灵魂触碰]！
                I met up with Roam [[founder]] [[Conor White-Sullivan]] last week in [[San Francisco]] and had a nice long [[walk-and-talk chat]] around the Mission with him. People who pull off [[impressive feats]] 取得令人印象深刻的成就 of visionary [[product engineering]] 有远见的产品工程 often don’t quite [recognize what they’ve done], but that’s [not the case with with] Conor. He [knows what he’s doing], he knows the history ([[aka]] [idea maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze)) of [the product he’s built], and he’s got the [opinionated approach] 固执己见的 I look for when adopting a [[commercial product]]. #[[idea maze]]
                    - He’s also nailed the essential [[message-of-the-medium]] [[use case]] of Roam: [conspiracy theories]. Or alternately, [extended-universe building]. We’re in [a fake-news world]([[fake news]]) and we might as well [get good at it]. __Good__ in [[both senses]] of the term. 在该术语的两种意义上 -- (__个人理解：网状结构天然的发散性__) -- detail point 100 (pt9-100)
                    - nail: 钉牢, 固定 ; 抓获并证明有罪 ; 证明…不属实 ; 揭露 ; 揭发 
                    - It can also do [[note-taking]], [[workflow]]s (like kinda-sorta [[competitor]] [[Note-taking/Notion]]), 有点像竞争对手 and [[wiki-like]] [[knowledge management]], but those [use cases] are [not as interesting to me]. Conspiracy theories and [extended universes], [in the best senses of] those terms — [[escaped reality]] construction might be the [[general category]] — is what Roam __wants __to be about.

                    - The name, incidentally, is a [[play-on-words joke]] apparently. As in Rome wasn’t built in a day.
- ### Substack
    - [[RSS]] had its [[rise and fall]], going from [seemingly promising] 看似有前途的 [[consumer technology]] to limited-use [[backend plumbing]]. 后端管道 [Email]([[email]]) has now [decisively reclaimed] its [[dominant role]] as the [[last mile]] of [[push communications]]. 推送通信
210226-12:30
    - [Email newsletters] are [as old as the internet], and as far as [dinosaur technologies] go, email appears to be [[unkillable]]. [For a while] [it looked like] [[Slack]] would do it, but sadly, Slack went too corporate to [realize that possibility].
210226-12:40
        - Email today is now less a [[communications medium]] than a [communications compile target]. 通信编译目标 It’s a [[clearinghouse]] technology. 票据交换所 It’s where [[conversations-of-record]] go, where [[identity verification]] happens, where [[service alert]]s accumulate, and perhaps [most importantly for] [[publisher]]s, where push-delivered [[longform content]] goes by default. It is [[distributed]] and federated, near [[universal]], and is not [[monopolized]] by a [[single provider]]. Now that [a constellation of] 一系列 [other product categories] have [hived off around it] [in the last two decades], it’s [finally finding] its own [true nature].
210226-12:49
        - The [publishing side] though, has always been [rather janky]. In the 90s people [ran their own list-servs]. In the aughts, as [[permission marketing]] took off 随着许可营销的兴起 and the [[spam]] wars started, [traditional list-servs] [couldn’t really keep up] and email newsletters became [[contested territory]] 有争议的领土 in the [[arms race]] 军备竞赛 between [[marketing-communications platform]]s 营销传播平台 like Mailchimp and [[spam-filter algorithm]]s on [[email client]]s like [[Gmail]].
            - In the early tens, 在早期 while [[blogging]] reigned and [RSS was not dead yet] as a [[consumer distribution mode]], and [[twitter]] hadn’t [become dominant in] the [[link economy]], email newsletters for __writing__, as opposed to [[marketing]], languished. They [became associated with desperation]: [[spammy-hacky popups]] on sites [trying to get your email] [by any means necessary]. [Permission marketing] evolved from [Seth Godin]’s [original noble conception] to “Permission” marketing in [[scare quotes]]. 崇高构想 #writing

                - This is what Jeff Jarvis, a professor at [[City University of New York]], 市立大学 commends as "the link economy". www.[[ftchinese]].com
                    - But in this link, [hypostatic economy] of China 实体 is carrying higher [increase rate] all the time. danci.[911cha].com
            - The reversal began with [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/), but that [got bought out by] [[Mailchimp]] (and began to be viewed, correctly, as [business-model compromised]). 妥协, 折中
            - Sure, the machines had [dinky screens] and [janky keyboards]. 相当之小 www.[forbeschina].com
            - And the same ones who [slowed down their investing pace]([[investing]]) [in the middle AUGHTS], 戛然放缓了 when companies like Facebook were [just getting started]. www.[[fortunechina]].com
    - Enter Substack. Substack, by eschewing the [[marketing communication]]s (MarCom) market entirely, and [focusing on writers] people actually [wanted to read], [reversed the perceptions] of the technology. Instead of [trying to scam people into] [giving you “permission” to] [send them emails], Substack said, why not [charge them to subscribe]([[subscribe]]). 
210227-11:15
        - I’ve moved 1 of my 2 [active newsletters] (Breaking Smart, with about 7300 subscribers) from Mailchimp to Substack, and [started a new one there] (Art of Gig, currently at 1756). I’ll probably move my [[auto-generated-from-RSS]] ribbonfarm [[newsletter]] there too. I’ve left it on MailChimp [for the moment], because moving it would mean [de-automating it]. 去自动化
        - By offering a [[seamlessly integrated]] email, 无缝集成的 [[payment integration]] ([[Stripe]] is [a big part of] [all these revolutions]([[revolution]])), and no-design-needed opinionated web presentation, Substack managed to basically resurrect a zombie category of text media that hadn’t really existed in this kind of pure form since the 90s.

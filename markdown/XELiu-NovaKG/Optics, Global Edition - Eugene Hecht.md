    - **__Optics__, Fifth Edition** is distinguished by three core imperatives for the reader: [up-to-date content] in line with 符合 the [ever-evolving technological advances] 不断发展的技术进步 [in the Optics field]; a [modern approach] to discourse including studies on photons, phasors, and theory; and [improvements and revisions to] the [previous edition]’s pedagogy including over one hundred [new worked examples].

    - The creation of this 5th edition was guided by three [overarching imperatives]: 首要任务 wherever possible, to [improve the pedagogy]; to continue to [modernize the treatment] (e.g., with a bit more on photons, phasors, and Fourier); and to [update the content] to [keep pace with technological advances](((JaBizLkjM))) (e.g., the book now discusses atomic interferometers, and metamaterials). Optics is [a fast-evolving field] and this edition strives to provide [an up-to-date approach] to the discipline, all the while [focusing mainly on pedagogy].

            - In chapters to come we will evolve a formal treatment of much of the science of Optics, with particular emphasis on aspects of contemporary interest. The subject embraces a vast body of knowledge accumulated over roughly three thousand years of the human scene. Before embarking on a study of the modern view of things optical, let’s briefly trace the road that led us there, if for no other reason than to put it all in perspective.

- The photoelectric effect is [the emission of electrons]([[electron emission]]) when [[electromagnetic radiation]], such as light, hits a material. [Electrons emitted in this manner] are called [[photoelectron]]s. The phenomenon is studied in [[condensed matter physics (CMP)]], and [solid state] and [[quantum chemistry]] to [draw inferences about] 推论 [the properties of atoms], molecules and solids. The effect [has found use in] [[electronic device]]s specialized for [[light detection]] and [precisely timed electron emission](((dswm8FX_K))).

    - The [[experimental result]]s disagree with [[classical electromagnetism]], which predicts that [continuous light waves] [transfer energy to electrons], which would then be emitted when they [accumulate enough energy]. An alteration in the [intensity of light]([[light intensity]]) would [theoretically change] the [[kinetic energy]] of the [emitted electrons], with [sufficiently dim light] resulting in a [[delayed emission]]. [The experimental results instead show that] [electrons are dislodged only when] the light [exceeds a certain frequency](((gjM-XVdnF)))—regardless of the [light's intensity] or [duration of exposure](((DeQZIkPJ4))). Because a [low-frequency beam] [at a high intensity] [could not build up the energy required to] [produce photoelectrons] like it would have if [light's energy] was coming from a [[continuous wave]], [Albert Einstein proposed that] [a beam of light](((JJwM0Unm3))) is not [a wave propagating through space], but a swarm of discrete [[energy packet]]s, known as [[photon]]s.

    - Emission of conduction electrons from typical metals requires a few electron-volt (eV) light quanta, corresponding to short-wavelength visible or ultraviolet light. In extreme cases, emissions are induced with photons approaching zero energy, like in systems with negative electron affinity and the emission from excited states, or a few hundred keV photons for core electrons in elements with a high atomic number.[1] Study of the photoelectric effect led to important steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced the formation of the concept of wave–particle duality.[2] Other phenomena where light affects the movement of electric charges include the photoconductive effect, the photovoltaic effect, and the photoelectrochemical effect.

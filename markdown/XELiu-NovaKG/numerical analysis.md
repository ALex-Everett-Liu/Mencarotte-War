- Numerical analysis is the study of [[algorithm]]s that use [[numerical approximation]] (as opposed to [[symbolic manipulation]]s) for the problems of [[mathematical analysis]] (as distinguished from [[discrete mathematics]]). Numerical analysis [naturally finds application in] [all fields of engineering] and the [[physical science]]s, but in the 21st century also the [[life science]]s, [[social science]]s, [[medicine]], [[business]] and even the [[art]]s have [adopted elements of] [[scientific computation]]s.

    - [The growth in computing power] has [revolutionized the use of] [realistic mathematical models]([[mathematical model]]) in [science and engineering], and [subtle numerical analysis] is required to implement these [detailed models of the world]. For example, [[ordinary differential equation (ODE)]]s appear in [[celestial mechanics]] (predicting the motions of planets, stars and galaxies; [[numerical linear algebra]] is important for [[data analysis]];[2][3][4] [[stochastic differential equation]]s and [[Markov chain]]s are essential in simulating [[living cell]]s 模拟活细胞 [for medicine and biology].
